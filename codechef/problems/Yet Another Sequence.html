<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>
You are given the first N terms of a sequence.<br>
The remaining terms of the sequence are defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
A [ i ] = number of j such that 0 ≤ j &lt; i and A[ j ] ≥ i - j
</p></blockquote>
<p>The sequence is indexed starting at 0.<br>
The first N terms of the sequence will each be equal to N-1, N, or N+1.</p>
<p>In addition to the first terms of the sequence, you will be given a number of queries.<br>
For each query you are to calculate the value of the sequence at that index.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case begins with 2 integers N and Q on a line,<br>
followed by a line with N integers (each equal to N-1, N, or N+1),<br>
then a line with Q non-negative integers.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output Q integers on a line, one per query,<br>
indicating the respective element of the sequence.</p>
