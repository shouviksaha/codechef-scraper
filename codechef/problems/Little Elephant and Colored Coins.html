<p>The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv very likes coins. But most of all he likes colored coins.</p>
<p>He has <b>N</b> types of coins, numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>, inclusive. The coin of the <b>i</b>-th type has the value <b>V<sub>i</sub></b> dollars and the color <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>. Note that he has infinite supply of each type of coins.</p>
<p>The Little Elephant wants to make exactly <b>S</b> dollars using the coins. What is the maximal number of different colors he can use to make exactly <b>S</b> dollars using some of the coins he has? If it's impossible, output <b>-1</b>. Also note that the Little Elephant wants to know this for many values of <b>S</b>.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>N</b>, denoting the number of types of coins. Each of the following <b>N</b> lines contains two space-separated integers <b>V<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>, denoting the value and the color of the coin of the <b>i</b>-th type. The next line contains a single integer <b>Q</b>, denoting the number of values of <b>S</b> to process. Each of the following <b>Q</b> lines contains a single integer <b>S</b>, denoting the coinage you should represent via given coins using maximum number of colors.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each value of <b>S</b> in the input, output the maximum number of different colors in the representation of <b>S</b> or <b>-1</b> if it is impossible to represent <b>S</b> via given coins.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ <b>30</b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>V<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ <b>200000</b> (<b>2 * 10<sup>5</sup></b>)</li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>Q</b> ≤ <b>200000</b> (<b>2 * 10<sup>5</sup></b>)</li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>S</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>18</sup></b></li>
</ul><p> </p>

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>It is not possible to represent <b>S = 1</b> since every coin has value more than 1.</li>
<li><b>S = 3</b> can only be represented using one coin of the second type, hence only one color is used in the representation.</li>
<li><b>S = 5</b> can only be represented as <b>2 + 3</b>, which leads to two colors used.</li>
<li>For <b>S = 7</b> we have two representations as <b>2 + 2 + 3</b> (with two colors used) and <b>3 + 4</b> (with one color used). Hence, the answer is 2.</li>
