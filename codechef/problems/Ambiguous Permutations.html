Some programming contest problems are really tricky: not only do they<br>
require a different output format from what you might have expected, but<br>
also the sample output does not show the difference. For an example,<br>
let us look at permutations.<br>
A <b>permutation</b> of the integers <i>1</i> to <i>n</i> is an<br>
ordering of<br>
these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is<br>
to list the integers in this order. With <i>n = 5</i>, a<br>
permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. <br>
However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation:<br>
You create a list of numbers where the <i>i</i>-th number is the<br>
position of the integer <i>i</i> in the permutation.<br>
Let us call this second<br>
possibility an <b>inverse permutation</b>. The inverse permutation<br>
for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.<br><br>
An <b>ambiguous permutation</b> is a permutation which cannot be<br>
distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2<br>
for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same.<br>
To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a<br>
program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.

<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<p>The input contains several test cases.<br>
The first line of each test case contains an integer <i>n</i><br>
(<i>1 ≤ n ≤ 100000</i>).<br>
Then a permutation of the integers <i>1</i> to <i>n</i> follows<br>
in the next line. There is exactly one space character<br>
between consecutive integers.<br>
You can assume that every integer between <i>1</i> and <i>n</i><br>
appears exactly once in the permutation.<br><br>
The last test case is followed by a zero.

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
<p>For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not.<br>
Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.
