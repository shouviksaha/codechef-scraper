<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Long long ago, there is a magic board. The magic board has <b>N*N</b> cells: <b>N</b> rows and <b>N</b> columns. Every cell contains one integer, which is <b>0</b> initially. Let the rows and the columns be numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>.</p>
<p>There are <b>2</b> types of operations can be applied to the magic board:</p>
<ol><li><b>RowSet i x</b>: it means that all integers in the cells on <b>row i</b> have been changed to <b>x</b> after this operation.</li>
<li><b>ColSet i x</b>: it means that all integers in the cells on <b>column i</b> have been changed to <b>x</b> after this operation.</li>
</ol><p>And your girlfriend sometimes has an interest in the total number of the integers <b>0</b>s on some row or column.</p>
<ol><li><b>RowQuery i</b>: it means that you should answer the total number of <b>0</b>s on <b>row i</b>.</li>
<li><b>ColQuery i</b>: it means that you should answer the total number of <b>0</b>s on <b>column i</b>.</li>
</ol><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains <b>2</b> space-separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b>. They indicate the size of the magic board, and the total number of operations and queries from the girlfriend.</p>
<p>Then each of the next <b>Q</b> lines contains an operation or a query by the format mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each query, output the answer of the query.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><b>1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 500000 (5 * 10<sup>5</sup>)</b><br><b>1 ≤ i ≤ N</b><br><b>x ∈ {0, 1}</b> (That is, <b>x = 0</b> or <b>1</b>)</p>
<h3>Sample</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3 6
RowQuery 1
ColSet 1 1
RowQuery 1
ColQuery 1
RowSet 1 0
ColQuery 1

<b>Output:</b>
3
2
0
1
</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
At first, the magic board is</p>
<pre><b>000 &lt;- row 1
000
000
</b></pre><p>So the answer of first query <i>"RowQuery 1"</i> is <b>3</b>.</p>
<p>
After the <i>"ColSet 1 1"</i>, the board becomes</p>
<pre><b>column 1
|
V
100
100
100
</b></pre><p>So the answer of the second query <i>"RowQuery 1"</i> is clearly <b>2</b>, since the cell <b>(1,1)</b> became <b>1</b>. And the answer of the third query <i>"ColQuery 1"</i> is <b>0</b>.</p>
<p>
Finally, apply the operation <i>"RowSet 1 0"</i>, the board has changed to</p>
<pre><b>000
100
100
</b></pre><p>From this board, the answer of the last query <i>"ColQuery 1"</i> should be <b>1</b>.</p>
