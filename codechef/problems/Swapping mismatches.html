<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>You are given a sequence <var>w</var> of integers. A mismatch is any such pair of neighbouring elements of sequence w[i] and w[i+1], that w[i]&gt;w[i+1]+1.<br>
As long as there is any mismatch, you solve it by swapping the mismatching numbers. Given an input sequence, calculate one of the possible output mismatch-less sequences obtained by successively solving mistmatches by swapping.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First - 1&lt;=<var>t</var>&lt;=10 - the number of tests. For each test: first - 1&lt;=<var>n</var>&lt;=100000. Then, <var>n</var> nonnegative integers.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test, you should output exactly <var>n</var> integers.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
