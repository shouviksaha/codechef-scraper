<p>
The country in which Chef Ciel lives has many earthquakes.<br>
Since Ciel's restaurant is far away from an evacuation center, Ciel is afraid of earthquakes.<br>
So, Ciel would like to know the probability that Ciel can reach from Ciel's restaurant to the evacuation center when an earthquake occurs.<br>
Your task is calculating the probability under the following assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Ciel's city has <strong>R</strong>*<strong>C</strong> junctions (<strong>i</strong>, <strong>j</strong>) for 1 ≤ <strong>i</strong> ≤ <strong>R</strong>, 1 ≤ <strong>j</strong> ≤ <strong>C</strong>.<br>
There is a two-way road between the junctions (<strong>r</strong><sub>1</sub>, <strong>c</strong><sub>1</sub>) and (<strong>r</strong><sub>2</sub>, <strong>c</strong><sub>2</sub>) if and only if |<strong>r</strong><sub>1</sub> - <strong>r</strong><sub>2</sub>| + |<strong>c</strong><sub>1</sub> - <strong>c</strong><sub>2</sub>| = 1.<br>
When an earthquake occurs, each road is destroyed with probability <strong>p</strong>, and these events are statistically independent of each other.<br>
Ciel's restaurant is in the junction (1, 1), and the evacuation center is in the junction (<strong>R</strong>, <strong>C</strong>).<br>
Ciel only considers a big earthquake, so you can assume that <strong>p</strong> is not less than 0.1.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line contains an integer <strong>T</strong>, the number of test cases.<br>
Then <strong>T</strong> test cases follow.<br>
Each test case has 3 numbers <strong>R</strong>, <strong>C</strong> and <strong>p</strong>, where <strong>R</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are integers.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case output the required probability.<br>
Your answer must have an absolute error no more than 0.000001 (10<sup>-6</sup>).
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1 ≤ <strong>T</strong> ≤ 50<br>
1 ≤ <strong>R</strong> ≤ 8<br>
1 ≤ <strong>C</strong> ≤ 1000000000000000000 (10<sup>18</sup>)<br>
0.1 ≤ <strong>p</strong> ≤ 1<br><strong>p</strong> has at most four digits after the decimal point.
