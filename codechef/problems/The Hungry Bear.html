<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Little Bear had just come back from school. He was very hungry that time and wanted at least K units of honey to satisfy his hunger. He immediately went to a rectangular field of size N x M to collect some honey. He wanted to collect honey only<br>
in a special sub-rectangle which has size S x T where S&lt;=A and T&lt;=B, for some fixed A and B. He has Q queries, each query contains A, B. For each query, he wanted to know how many special sub-rectangles contain at least K units of honey. </p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line of the input contains integers N, M  and K(1&lt;=N, M&lt;=300, 1&lt;=K&lt;=N*M).<br>
The next N lines contain M characters (either 'H' or '.'). 'H' means there is honey in that cell, while '.' means there is no honey in that cell.<br>
The next line contains an integer Q (1&lt;=Q&lt;=100 000).<br>
The next Q lines contain integers A and B (1&lt;=A&lt;=N , 1&lt;=B&lt;=M).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output contains Q lines, each line contains the number of special sub-rectangles which satisfy the requirement. (The amount of honey is at least K inside the special sub-rectangle)</p>
