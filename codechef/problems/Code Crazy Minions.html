Coding in Sprout (a programming language) is very intuitive. Chef is giving his minions a demonstration in Sprout and wants you to<br>
help him determine if they are not too difficult for them.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
A program in Sprout is written using three kinds of instructions.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><ul><li>Load Instruction: Load a value into buffer.</li>
<li>Increment Instruction: Increment the value in buffer.</li>
<li>Print Instruction: Print the value from buffer.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align:justify">
The buffer stores a single integer between 0 and 25, both inclusive. If the value in the buffer is x, the increment instruction<br>
makes the value (x+1), if x &lt; 25. At x = 25 the increment instruction makes the value 0.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Load Instruction can be used to load any value between 0 and 25 (inclusive) into the buffer.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Print from the buffer prints a lowercase English character based on the value in the buffer. Precisely, it prints the (x+1)th character<br>
in the alphabet. Thus, for x = 0, 'a' is printed; x = 1, 'b' is printed and so on. For x = 25, 'z' is printed.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
To keep his programs clear, he uses the load instruction only once in the beginning (before printing any character). Then<br>
he proceeds instruction after instruction. A program is simple, if the number of instructions is not more than ELEVEN times the length<br>
of the word that it prints.<br>
Given the word Chef wants his program to print and assuming he will write the shortest code (i.e. use the fewest instructions)<br>
to print it, will the program be simple?
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Each test case contains 1 word on a line by itself - the word that would be printed by Chef's program.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Assuming Chef writes the shortest code (with minimum instructions) to print the given word, output "YES" if this code is not more than<br>
ELEVEN times the length of the word being printed; "NO" otherwise
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><pre>1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ length of word ≤ 1000
</pre>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><pre>2
helloworld
mississippi
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><pre>NO
YES
</pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The optimal program length for mississippi is 112 instructions and that is smaller than 121 (length of 'mississippi' * 11)
