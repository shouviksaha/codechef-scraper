The Chef is enjoying a wonderful vacation in Byteland. What makes the Chef impressed the most is the road system of the country. Byteland has <b>N</b> cities numbered 1 through <b>N</b>. City 1 is the capital of Byteland. The country also has <b>N</b>-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities. The <b>i</b>-th road connects two different cities <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>. In this road system, people can travel between every pair of different cities by going through exactly one path of roads.
</p>
<p>
The roads are arranged in such a way that people can distinguish two cities only when both cities have different number of roads connected to it. Such two cities will be considered <i>similar</i>. For example, city <b>A</b> is similar to the capital if the number of roads connected to city <b>A</b> is equal to the number of roads connected to the capital.
</p>
<p>
On each day during the vacation, the Chef wants to have a trip as follows. He chooses two cities <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> such that the Chef will visit city <b>B</b> if he goes from <b>A</b> to the capital using the shortest path. Then, the Chef will visit the cities on the shortest path from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b> through this path. Please note that <b>A</b> may be equal to <b>B</b>; that means the Chef will enjoy the day in a single city.
</p>
<p>
The Chef does not want to have <i>similar</i> trips. Two trips are considered <i>similar</i> if and only if<br>
they both have the same number of visited cities and for each <b>i</b>, the <b>i</b>-th city visited in one trip is <i>similar</i> to the <b>i</b>-th city visited in the other trip.
</p>
<p>
The Chef wants to have as many different, namely not <i>similar</i>, trips as possible. Help him count the maximum number of possible trips such that no two of them are similar.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Input</h3>

<p>
The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>N</b>. The <b>i</b>-th line of next <b>N</b>-1 lines contains two space-separated integers <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>, denoting the <b>i</b>-th road.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output a single line containing the maximum number of different trips.
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 100000 (10<sup>5</sup>)<br><b>u<sub>i</sub></b> ≠ <b>v<sub>i</sub></b></p>
<p>Every pair of different cities can be traveled by going through exactly one path of roads.</p>
<h3>Sample</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input</b>:
3
2 1
3 1

<b>Output</b>:
3
</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
In the sample, the country consists of three cities.<br>
There are two roads. The first road connects city 1 and city 2.<br>
The second road connects city 1 and city 3.<br>
Each day, the Chef can choose the following possible trips:
</p>
<ul><li>
<b>A</b> = 1, <b>B</b> = 1
</li>
<li>
<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 2
</li>
<li>
<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 3
</li>
<li>
<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 1
</li>
<li>
<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 1
</li>
</ul><p>
However, since the trip (<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 2) is similar to the trip (<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 3),<br>
and the trip (<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 1) is similar to the trip (<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 1),<br>
there are only three possible different trips for the Chef.
