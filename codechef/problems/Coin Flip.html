<b>Little Elephant</b> was fond of inventing new games. After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games.Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named <b>COIN FLIP</b>.
</p>
<p>
In this game the player will use <b>N</b> coins numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>, and all the coins will be facing in "Same direction" (Either <b>Head</b> or <b>Tail</b>),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.
</p>
<p>
The player needs to play <b>N</b> rounds.In the <b>k</b>-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to <b>k</b>. That is, the face of coin <b>i</b> will be reversed, from <b>Head</b> to <b>Tail</b>, or, from <b>Tail</b> to <b>Head</b>, for <b>i</b> ≤ <b>k</b>.
</p>
<p>
Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing <b>N</b> rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game <b>COIN FLIP</b>, so Elephant plays <b>G</b> times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases.<br>
Then <b>T</b> test cases follow.
</p>
<p>
The first line of each test contains an integer <b>G</b>, denoting the number of games played by Elephant. Each of the following <b>G</b> lines denotes a single game, and contains 3 space separeted integers <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>Q</b>, where <b>I</b> denotes the initial state of the coins, <b>N</b> denotes the number of coins and rounds, and <b>Q</b>, which is either 1, or 2 as explained below.</p>
<p>
Here <b>I=1</b> means all coins are showing <b>Head</b> in the start of the game, and <b>I=2</b> means all coins are showing <b>Tail</b> in the start of the game. <b>Q=1</b> means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <b>Head</b> in the end of the game, and <b>Q=2</b> means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <b>Tail</b> in the end of the game.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each game, output one integer denoting the total number of coins showing the particular face in the end of the game.
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
<b>1 ≤ T ≤ 10</b></p>
<p><b>1 ≤ G ≤ 20000</b></p>
<p><b>1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>9</sup></b></p>
<p><b>1 ≤ I ≤ 2</b></p>
<p><b>1 ≤ Q ≤ 2</b>
</p>
<pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<b>Input:</b>
1
2
1 5 1
1 5 2

<b>Output:</b>
2
3
</pre><h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>
<b>In the 1st game in Example:</b><br><b>I=1</b>, so initial arrangement of coins are H H H H H,<br>
and now Elephant will play 5 rounds and coin faces will be changed as follows</p>
<p>After the 1st Round: <b>T</b> H H H H</p>
<p>After the 2nd Round: <b>H T</b> H H H</p>
<p>After the 3rd Round: <b>T H T</b> H H</p>
<p>After the 4th Round: <b>H T H T</b> H</p>
<p>After the 5th Round: <b>T H T H T</b>
</p>
<p>
Finally <b>Q=1</b>, so we need to find the total number of coins showing <b>Head</b>, which is <b>2</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>In the 2nd game in Example:</b><br>
This is similar to the 1st game, except Elephant needs to find the total number of coins showing <b>Tail</b>.<br>
So the Answer is <b>3</b>. (Please see the final state of the coins in the 1st game)
