<p>Frank explained its friend Felman the algorithm of Euclides to calculate the GCD<br>
of two numbers. Then Felman implements it algorithm </p>
<pre>
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
	if (b==0)
		return a;
	else
		return gcd(b,a%b);
}
</pre><p>and it proposes to Frank that makes it<br>
but with a little integer and another integer that has up to 250 digits.
</p><p>
Your task is to help Frank programming an efficient code for the challenge of Felman.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input file contains a number representing the number of lines to follow.<br>
Each line consists of two number A and B (0 &lt;= A &lt;= 40000 and A &lt;= B &lt; 10^250).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print for each pair (A,B) in the input one integer representing the GCD of A and B.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
