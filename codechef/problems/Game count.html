<p>Tug of war is a sport that directly puts two teams against each other in a test of strength.</p>
<p>During school days, both Chef Shifu and Chef Po were champions of tug of war.<br>
On behalf of restaurant's anniversary, Chef Shifu and Chef Po have decided to conduct<br>
a tug of war game for their customers.</p>
<p></p><p><br>
Master Chef Oogway has decided the following rules for the game.</p>
<ol><li>
    Let <b>N</b> be the number of players participating in the game. All of these<br>
    players would stand in a circle in clock wise direction.
    </li>
<li>
    There are an infinite number of long ropes available.<br>
    When a rope is held by exactly two players, it is termed as bonding.
    </li>
<li>
    At least one bonding is necessary to conduct a game.
    </li>
<li>
    A player can play against multiple people simultaneously i.e he can have more than one bonding at<br>
    the same time.
    </li>
<li>
    Both members of a pair of players that have a bonding must have the same number of total<br>
    bondings. That is, if the player <i>A</i>  makes bonding with the player <i>B</i>,<br>
    then the number of total bondings of the player <i>A</i> must be the same as<br>
    that of the player <i>B</i>.
    </li>
<li>
    Bondings should be created in such a fashion that ropes must not intersect each other.
    </li>
<li>
    The number of bondings of every player must be no more than <b>K</b>.
    </li>
</ol><p>
Now Master Chef Oogway asked Chef Shifu and Chef Po to find out the number of possible games.<br>
Your task is to help them find this number. As this number might become huge,<br>
you've to find it modulo (10^14+7). Two games are different iff there is some<br>
bonding that is present in only of them. </p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases.<br>
Each of <b>T</b> lines contain 2 positive integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> separated by a space.
</p>
<p></p><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output the number of ways to conduct the game modulo 100000000000007 (10<sup>14</sup>+7) in one line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
3 2
4 0
2 1

<b>Output:</b>
4
0
1
</pre><p>
<b>Explanation:</b></p>
<p>For the 1st case, there are 3 players. Let's call them p1, p2, p3.<br>
Different games possible are:<br>
Game 1: p1-p2 (numbers of bondings of p1, p2 are 1 ≤ <b>K</b> = 2)<br>
Game 2: p1-p3 (numbers of bondings of p1, p3 are 1 ≤ <b>K</b> = 2)<br>
Game 3: p2-p3 (numbers of bondings of p2, p3 are 1 ≤ <b>K</b> = 2)<br>
Game 4: p1-p2, p1-p3, p2-p3 (numbers of bondings of p1, p2, p3 are 2 ≤ <b>K</b><br>
= 2)</p>
<p>For the 2nd test case, we cannot form the game, because K = 0 and hence no<br>
player is allowed to make any bonding. As any game must have atleast one<br>
bonding, no game is possible here. </p>
<p>For the 3rd case, only possible game is:<br>
Game 1: p1-p2 (number of bondings in p1, p2 are 1)</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 10000<br>
0 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 10000<br>
0 ≤ <b>K</b> ≤ <b>N</b></p>
