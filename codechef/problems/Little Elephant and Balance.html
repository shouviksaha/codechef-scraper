<p>A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes <i>lucky strings</i>, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p>The Little Elephant calls some string <b>T</b> of the length <b>M</b> <i>balanced</i> if there exists at least one integer <b>X</b> (<b>1 ≤ X ≤ M</b>) such that the number of digits <b>4</b> in the substring <b>T[1, X - 1]</b> is equal to the number of digits <b>7</b> in the substring <b>T[X, M]</b>. For example, the string <b>S = 7477447</b> is balanced since <b>S[1, 4] = 7477</b> has 1 digit <b>4</b> and <b>S[5, 7] = 447</b> has 1 digit <b>7</b>. On the other hand, one can verify that the string <b>S = 7</b> is not balanced.</p>
<p> The Little Elephant has the string <b>S</b> of the length <b>N</b>. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers <b>(L; R)</b> that <b>1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N</b> and the substring <b>S[L, R] </b> is balanced. Help him to find this number.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b></p>
<p>Let <b>S</b> be some lucky string. Then</p>
<ul><li><b>|S|</b> denotes the length of the string <b>S</b>;
</li>
<li><b>S[i]</b> (<b>1 ≤ i ≤ |S|</b>) denotes the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> character of <b>S</b> (the numeration of characters starts from <b>1</b>);
</li>
<li> <b>S[L, R]</b> (<b>1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ |S|</b>) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: <b>S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R]</b>, and is called a <i>substring</i> of <b>S</b>. For <b>L &gt; R</b> we mean by <b>S[L, R]</b> an empty string.
</li>
</ul><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input file contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Each of the following <b>T</b> lines contains one string, the string <b>S</b> for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p> 1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 10
</p>
<p> 1 ≤ <b>|S|</b> ≤ 100000
</p>
<p> <b>S</b> consists only of the lucky digits <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
4
47
74
477
4747477

<b>Output:</b>
2
2
3
23

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>In the first test case balance substrings are <b>S[1, 1] = 4</b> and <b>S[1, 2] = 47</b>.</p>
<p>In the second test case balance substrings are <b>S[2, 2] = 4</b> and <b>S[1, 2] = 74</b>.</p>
<p><b>Unfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.</b></p>
