<p>
Given <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> Dexter wants to know how many pairs <b>a,b(1 &lt;= a &lt; b &lt;=N)</b> are there such that <b>(a+b)</b> is divisible by <b>M</b>.<br>
For example when <b>N=4</b> and <b>M=3</b>, there are 2 possible pairs the sum of which is divisible by <b>M</b>  and they are (1,2) and (2,4).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
First line of input contains <b>T(&lt;=100000)</b> which is the number of test cases. Each of the next <b>T</b> lines contains two integers <b>N(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^9)</b> and <b>M(2 &lt;= M &lt;= 10^9)</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Output one line per testcase, the number of pairs <b>(a,b)</b> as described before.</p>
