In the magic land, there is an annual parade hold on each spring.<br><br><br><br><br>
There are <b>N</b> cities in magic land, and <b>M</b> directed roads between cities.<br><br><br>
On the parade, there will be some(may be 0) heroes travel in this land, for each hero:<br>
He start at city begin[i], traveling to some cities, and finish at city end[i]. Note that: begin[i] may be equals to end[i], but he must at least moved to another city during this travel. He can go on one road many times, but it will have a cost for each time.<br><br><br><br><br>
The cost of this parade is the sum of these items:<br><br><br>
1. The sum of costs by traveling on roads. (If a road is passed by k heroes, then it must be count k times.)<br><br><br>
2. If for a hero, he ended at a city that not equals to his start city, i.e. begin[i] != end[i], then it will cost <b>C</b> dollars to move him back to his home.<br><br><br>
3. If for a city, there is no heroes visited, then we must pay for the citizen <b>C</b> dollars as compensate.<br><br><br><br><br>
The value of <b>C</b> may change every year, and we can predict this value in the following <b>K</b> years.<br>
Your task is: calculate the minimal cost of each year.<br><br></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
In the first line, there are 3 integers: <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>K</b>.<br><br><br>
In the following <b>M</b> lines:<br><br><br>
there will be 3 integers: <b>S[i]</b>, <b>T[i]</b>, and <b>V[i]</b>, describing a directed road from <b>S[i]</b> to <b>T[i]</b>, cost <b>V[i]</b> dollars.<br><br><br>
In the next <b>K</b> lines:<br>
There will be an integer: <b>C[i]</b>, describing the value of <b>C</b> in that year.<br><br></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output <b>K</b> lines:<br>
each line contain an integer, corresponding to the minimal cost of each year.</p>

</pre><p><br><br><b>Explanation</b><br><br><br>
In the first year, since <b>C</b> is very small, an optimal solution is: no hero travel, we pay 1 dollar for each city as compensate.<br><br><br>
In the second year, an optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5. We pay 2+2+2=6 dollars for the roads, 5 dollars for taking him back to city 1, and pay 5 dollars for city 2 and 6 as compensate.<br><br><br>
In the third year, one optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5, and another hero traveling in the path: 2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;6.</p>
