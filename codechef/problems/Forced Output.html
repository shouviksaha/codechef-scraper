<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>

The state space of the output of this problem (and as a matter of fact, all the problems in this Cook-Off) is - 2 to the power T -<br>
where T is the number of test cases (so be extra careful!). Each test case consists of T lines consisting of "YES" or "NO".<br>
If a test case accurately represents the output that you would print for this file,<br>
then print "YES" for this case. Print "NO" otherwise.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The output for a file is defined as the output for all the test cases one by one. If you output "YES" for test case 'x', then your output<br>
must match the input for the test case 'x', and if and only if your output does not match the input for test case 'x', should you print "NO"<br>
for that case.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Each test case contains T lines. Each line is either "YES" or "NO". The T lines together represent the candidate output for this problem.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
If the candidate-output (that you got in the input) is what you are going to print then print "YES", and<br>
only if it is different, print "NO". The output for each case must be on a single line by itself.
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><pre>1 ≤ T ≤ 100
There is only one unique valid output that you can print
</pre>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><pre>2
NO
NO
NO
YES
</pre>
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><pre>NO
YES
</pre>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Your output clearly matches the input for the second case. No other output can be valid for this file.
