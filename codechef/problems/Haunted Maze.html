<p>
Chef is trapped in a haunted maze.<br>
There are ghosts that patrol the maze by following fixed paths.<br>
Chef is trying to escape the maze, but must avoid the ghosts or he will become frightened and faint.<br>
Additionally, Chef needs to escape within a certain amount of time, or he will faint from hunger.<br>
Your task is to determine if Chef can escape the maze without fainting, and if so the minimum time it will take.
</p>
<p>
You will be given the layout of the maze, including Chef's starting position, the position of<br>
the exit, and the patrol paths of the ghosts.<br>
There is a timer that keeps track of how long Chef has been in the maze.  The timer starts at 0.<br>
Each second, the following happens (in order):</p>
<ul><li>If the timer is equal to the maximum time Chef is allowed<br>
to spend in the maze, he will faint from hunger.</li>
<li>Chef may move to one of the adjacent cells of the maze (north, east, south, or west of his current<br>
position), provided that cell is neither a wall nor occupied by a ghost.<br>
Chef also has the option of standing still.
</li>
<li>All of the ghosts move to the next cell in their repsective patrol paths.<br>
If any ghost moves into the cell now occupied by Chef, Chef will faint.</li>
<li>The timer is incremented by 1.</li>
<li>If Chef is now standing at the location of the exit, Chef successfully<br>
escapes the maze.</li>
</ul><p>
Ghost patrol paths will be given as a list of waypoints.<br>
Each waypoint will be in-line either horizontally or vertically with the next waypoint in the list,<br>
and the final waypoint will similarly be in-line with the first waypoint.<br>
Ghosts will move from waypoint to waypoint, one square at a time, using the shortest possible path.<br>
Once a ghost reaches its final waypoint, it will travel back to the first waypoint and repeat the cycle.<br>
For example, if a patrol path were given as the waypoints:<br>
(2,3) (1,3) (1,0) (0,0) (0,1) (2,1)<br>
Then the ghost's complete path would be:<br>
(2,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2)<br>
After which the sequence would repeat.
</p>
<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>
Input will begin with T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case begins with 4 integers: M, N, C, and K,<br>
where M is the height of the maze, N is the width of the maze,<br>
C is the number of ghosts, and K is the number of seconds before Chef will faint from hunger.<br>
C lines follow, each describing the patrol path of a ghost.<br>
Each patrol path begins with an integer L, the number of waypoints in the path, followed by L pairs of integers giving the (x,y)<br>
coordinates of a waypoint on the path, where (0,0) is the top-left corner and (N-1, M-1) is the bottom-right corner.<br>
Finally, M lines of N characters each describe the maze itself.  A '.' character indicates a passable square, and a<br>
'#' character indicates an impassable wall (although the ghosts may pass through walls).  A '@' character indicates<br>
the starting position of Chef (it is guaranteed that no ghost will begin here), and a '$' character indicates the exit<br>
of the maze (there will be exactly one '@' character and one '$' character in each test case).
</p>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>For each test case, if Chef can escape without fainting, print the minimum number of seconds it will take him to escape.<br>
Otherwise, print -1.</p>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>

1≤M,N≤30<br>
0≤C≤30<br>
0≤K≤100000<br>
