<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Chef is planning a grand cooking tournament for aspiring chefs in the region.<br>
The competition progresses with a number of one-on-one elimination rounds until only one chef remains.<br>
For each round, two chefs are chosen at random for a cook-off.<br>
The loser of the cook-off is elimited, while the winner moves on.<br>
Additionally, each chef begins with a positive number of prize tokens<br>
(some chefs begin with more than others, based on their performance in a qualification round).<br>
The winner of each cook-off receives all of the loser's prize tokens, and the loser is<br>
awarded a prize based on the number of prize tokens he/she had accrued.</p>
<p>The final cook-off always receives the most publicity.<br>
Your task it to compute the expected difference between the number of prize tokens of the final two<br>
competitors before the final cook-off.<br>
You will be given the number of tokens each chef begins with.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases (at most 50).<br>
Each test case consists of a single line, beginning with an integer C,<br>
the number of chefs in the competition, followed by C positive integers each describing the number<br>
of prize tokens a chef begins with.<br>
The total number of prize tokens among all chefs will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output the expected difference in prize tokens, rounded to 6 places<br>
after the decimal point.</p>
