The most important part of a GSM network is so called<br><em>Base Transceiver Station</em> (<em>BTS</em>). These transceivers form the<br>
areas called <em>cells</em> (this term gave the name to the cellular phone)<br>
and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in<br>
a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and<br>
technicians need to check their function periodically.<br><br><br></p><p><br>
The technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of<br>
BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the<br>
given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers<br>
have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They<br>
were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the<br>
programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he<br>
found that the problem is so called "Traveling Salesman Problem" and it is<br>
very hard to solve. If we have <var>N</var> BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in<br>
any order, giving us <var>N</var>! possibilities to examine. The function expressing<br>
that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product<br></p>
<p>1.2.3.4....<var>N</var>. The number is very high even for a relatively small <var>N</var>.<br><br></p>
<p></p><p><br>
The programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But<br>
because they have already received the research grant from the government,<br>
they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least <em>some</em><br>
results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function.<br><br><br></p><p><br>
For example, they defined the function <var>Z</var>. For any positive integer <var>N</var>,<br><var>Z</var>(<var>N</var>) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number<br><var>N</var>!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers<br><var>N</var><sub>1</sub>&lt;<var>N</var><sub>2</sub>, then<br><var>Z</var>(<var>N</var><sub>1</sub>) &lt;= <var>Z</var>(<var>N</var><sub>2</sub>). It is because we can never "lose" any<br>
trailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new<br>
and new zeros. The function <var>Z</var> is very interesting, so we need a computer<br>
program that can determine its value efficiently.</p>
<p></p><p><br></p><h3>Input</h3>
<p></p><p><br>
There is a single positive integer <var>T</var> on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands<br>
for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are <var>T</var> lines, each containing<br>
exactly one positive integer number <var>N</var>,<br>
1 &lt;= <var>N</var> &lt;= 1000000000.</p>
<p></p><p><br></p><h3>Output</h3>
<p></p><p><br>
For every number <var>N</var>, output a single line containing the single non-negative<br>
integer <var>Z</var>(<var>N</var>).</p>
