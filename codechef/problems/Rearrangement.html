<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">Emily has an array of <b>N</b> integers. She wants to rearrange its elements in such a way that the sum of any <b>K</b> <b>consecutive</b> elements of the rearranged array is divisible by <b>M</b>. She was able to accomplish this for several small cases. Help her with the larger ones.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases (no more than 5). Each test case is described by exactly two lines. The first of these lines contains three space-separated integers <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>K</b>, respectively (1 ≤ <b>K</b> ≤ 70, 2*<b>K</b> ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ <b>M</b> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>). The second of these lines contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> (0 ≤ <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">For each test case output exactly one line containing either a single integer -1 if there is no solution or a sequence of <b>N</b> space-separated integers which has the required property and is a permutation of the array <b>A</b> from the input. If there are several ways to do this, any of them will be accepted.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
6 4 3
6 1 1 9 2 5
8 2 3
2 5 0 9 1 9 9 4
8 5 3
1 9 0 1 1 9 9 1

<b>Output:</b>
2 9 1 6 5 1
2 5 9 0 9 9 4 1
-1
</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">There are 6 sequences of 3 consecutive numbers in (2 5 9 0 9 9 4 1). Formally:</p>
<ul><li>(2 5 9), sum = 16, which is divisible by 2</li>
<li>(5 9 0), sum = 14, which is divisible by 2</li>
<li>(9 0 9), sum = 18, which is divisible by 2</li>
<li>(0 9 9), sum = 18, which is divisible by 2</li>
<li>(9 9 4), sum = 22, which is divisible by 2</li>
<li>(9 4 1), sum = 14, which is divisible by 2</li>
</ul><p style="text-align:justify"><br>Another possible answer is (4 5 9 0 1 9 2 9).</p>
