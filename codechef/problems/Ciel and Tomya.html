Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.
</p>
<p>
Today, too, Tomya is going to Ciel's restaurant.<br>
Of course, Tomya would like to go to Ciel's restaurant as soon as possible.<br>
Therefore Tomya uses one of the shortest paths from Tomya's house to Ciel's restaurant.<br>
On the other hand, Tomya is boring now to use the same path many times.<br>
So Tomya wants to know the number of shortest paths from Tomya's house to Ciel's restaurant.<br>
Your task is to calculate the number under the following assumptions.
</p>
<p>
This town has <b>N</b> intersections and <b>M</b> two way roads.<br>
The <b>i</b>-th road connects from the <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>-th intersection to the <b>B<sub>i</sub></b>-th intersection, and its length is </p>
<p><b>C<sub>i</sub></b>.<br>
Tomya's house is in the 1st intersection, and Ciel's restaurant is in the <b>N</b>-th intersection.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line contains an integer <strong>T</strong>, the number of test cases.<br>
Then <strong>T</strong> test cases follow.<br>
The first line of each test case contains 2 integers <b>N</b>, <b>M</b>.<br>
Then next <b>M</b> lines contains 3 integers denoting <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>B<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case, print the number of shortest paths from Tomya's house to Ciel's restaurant.
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 10<br>
2 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 10<br>
1 ≤ <b>M</b> ≤ <b>N ∙ (N – 1) / 2</b><br>
1 ≤ <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>B<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ <b>N</b><br>
1 ≤ <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> ≤ 10<br><b>A<sub>i</sub></b> ≠ <b>B<sub>i</sub></b><br>
If <b>i</b> ≠ <b>j</b> and <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> = <b>A<sub>j</sub></b>, then <b>B<sub>i</sub></b> ≠ <b>B<sub>j</sub></b><br>
There is at least one path from Tomya's house to Ciel's restaurant.

<p>
In the first sample, only one shortest path exists, which is 1-3.
</p>
<p>
In the second sample, both paths 1-2-3 and 1-3 are the shortest paths.
