<p>
Given an <b>n</b>*<b>m</b> board with a number between -1 and <b>n</b>*<b>m</b> in every entries.</p>
<p>And an <b>n</b>*<b>m</b> matrix <b>M</b> is also given, where <b>M</b><sub>i,j</sub> is the cost of selecting the <i>(i,j)</i> entry of the given board.</p>
<p>Your task is to find a connected block (which means these entries can reach each other by just go up, down, left and right without going out the block) in the board that contains at least <b>K</b> distinct positive numbers without any -1, and it must have minimum total cost for selecting these entries. Output the minimum total cost.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>First line consists of three integers, <b>n</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>K</b> (1 &lt;= <b>n</b>, <b>m</b> &lt;= 15, 1 &lt;= <b>K</b> &lt;= 7).</p>
<p>The followings are two <b>n</b>*<b>m</b> matrices, the first denotes the numbers on the board and the second denotes the cost of every entry.</p>
<p>Namely, the first <b>n</b> lines contain <b>m</b> integers, where the <i>j</i>th number in <i>i</i>th line denotes the number on the entry (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) of the board. These integers are in [-1, <b>n</b>*<b>m</b>].</p>
<p>Next <b>n</b> lines contain <b>m</b> integers too. The <i>j</i>th number in <i>i</i>th line denotes the cost of selecting the entry (<i>i</i>,<i>j</i>) of the board. These integers are in [1, 100000].</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
Only one line contains the minimum cost to finish the task. If the task is impossible, output -1 please.</p>
