<p>Knowing Johnny's mathematical talent, our teacher has prepared a new interesting problem for him, hoping he will enjoy solving it. The problem description is given below.</p>
<p>"There is a rectangular room of length l and width w (l and w are integers). The length and width of the room  fulfill the relation l=Aw+B, where A and B are given integer constants. The room is divided into square cells of unit dimensions. You have observed that, after adding an integer C to the number of cells in the room, the number of cells becomes divisible by the prime number P. Find all the possible values of the width of the room."</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10000). Then t test cases follow. Each test case is given in one line containing 4 integers A, B, C and P (2 ≤ P &lt; 10<sup>6</sup>, 0 &lt; A &lt; P, 0 ≤ B,C &lt; P).</p>
<p>P is always a prime number.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, write the result in one line. The first number K is the number of solutions. Then K numbers X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...,X<sub>K</sub> follow (0 ≤ X<sub>i</sub> &lt; P) in increasing order, which are the solutions to the corresponding problems.</p>
