Chef Ciel lives in a long street which can be thought as of x-axis of coordinate system.<br>
Her house is at coordinate 0 whereas her restaurant is situated at coordinate <b>N</b>.<br>
Usually Ciel goes from home to restaurant taking a step of size 1 or 2 in forward direction.<br>
We all know how much Chef loves Fibonacci numbers.
</p>
<p>
But today, Ciel being little casual stepped in wrong direction on her way to her restaurant exactly once and of course she did not set her foot wrong at home.<br>
Now she wonders how many ways she can reach her restaurant provided that she stepped wrong once but not at home.<br><br> She does not go past her restaurant because it is altogether different world and once she reaches her restaurant she stops.
</p>

<p>
For example, if <b>N</b> is <b>3</b> then<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>-1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b>,<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>2</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b><br><br>
are some possible ways where as<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>-1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b>, (She did not set her foot wrong at her home)<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b>, (She sets her foot wrong direction exactly once)<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b>, (Her steps are always size 1 or 2)<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>2</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>4</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b>, (She does not go past her restaurant)<br><br><b>0</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>1</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>2</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>2</b> <span style="color:gray">-&gt;</span> <b>3</b> (Once she reaches her restaurant, she stops)<br><br>
are not.<br></p>
