<p>Do you know that The Chef has a special interest in palindromes? Yes he does! Almost all of the dishes in his restaurant is named by a palindrome strings. The problem is that a name of a dish should not be too long, so The Chef has only limited choices when naming a new dish.</p>
<p>For the given positive integer <b>N</b>, your task is to calculate the number of palindrome strings of length not exceeding <b>N</b>, that contain only lowercase letters of English alphabet (letters from 'a' to 'z', inclusive). Recall that a palindrome is a string that reads the same left to right as right to left (as in "radar").</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul><li>For <b>N = 1</b>, we have <b>26</b> different palindromes of length not exceeding <b>N</b>:<br> "a", "b", ..., "z".</li>
<li>For <b>N = 2</b> we have <b>52</b> different palindromes of length not exceeding <b>N</b>:<br> "a", "b", ..., "z",<br> "aa", "bb", ..., "zz".
</li>
<li>For <b>N = 3</b> we have <b>728</b> different palindromes of length not exceeding <b>N</b>:<br> "a", "b", ..., "z",<br> "aa", "bb", ..., "zz",<br> "aaa", "aba", ..., "aza",<br> "bab", "bbb", ..., "bzb",<br> ...,<br> "zaz", "zbz", ..., "zzz".
</li>
</ul><p>Since the answer can be quite large you should output it modulo <b>1000000007</b> (<b>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</b>). Yes, we know, most of you already hate this modulo, but there is nothing we can do with it :)</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.</p>
<h3>Constrains</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>1000</b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>
</ul><p> </p>
