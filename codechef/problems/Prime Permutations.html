<p>A permutation of N <b>distinct</b> integers between 1 and N, both inclusive, is called a prime permutation of size N iff - for all i between 1 and N, the following condition holds:</p>
<p>The i<sup>th</sup> integer is the X<sup>th</sup> smallest integer in the first i integers, where X is either 1 or a prime number.</p>
<p>Your task is to find out how many prime permutations are there of size N.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follow, each containing a single integer N.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the number of prime permutations of size N. Since the answers can be very large, output each answer modulo 1,000,000,007.</p>
