<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p align="justify">   The Chef is sleeping now. He tries to cook new kind of meals in his dream.<br><br><br>
These meals are arranged in a row and numbered from 1 to <b>N</b> consecutively. For each meal <i>i</i> (1&lt;=<i>i</i>&lt;=<b>N</b>) there </p>
<p>is given one integer <i>f(i)</i> which denotes the time needed to cook it. Initially, all meals are uncooked. Each assistant </p>
<p>of The Chef (there are infinite number of them) can help him with cooking.<br><br><br>
The abilities of all assistants are same. There can be at most one assistant cooking at each moment. He must choose some </p>
<p>continuous subsequence of meals with length <b>K</b>(any such subsequence can be chosen). And if there are uncooked meals in </p>
<p>it, he will cook all uncooked meals which has the minimum cooking time among uncooked meals in the chosen subsequence. </p>
<p>Nothing done to another meals.<br><br><br></p>
<p>   The dream was so interesting that he tried to solve such a problem: What is the minimum number of assistants which can </p>
<p>cook all the meals assuming that each of them will cook at most once?<br>
   But since the bell rings and Chef's friends has come to visit him, he will wake up after 2 seconds. Your program </p>
<p>should calculate the answer before The Chef will come to himself.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line of input file contains two integers <b>N</b> (1&lt;=<b>N</b>&lt;=10<sup>5</sup>) and <b>K</b> (1&lt;=<b>K</b>&lt;=<b>N</b>), </p>
<p>followed by a line containing <b>N</b> integers. The <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> integer denotes <i>f(i)</i>-the cooking time of </p>
<p>meal number <i>i</i> (1&lt;=<i>f(i)</i>&lt;=10<sup>9</sup>)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Print minimum number of assistans which can cook all the meals in one line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

3
</pre><p>
<br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br><br>3 assistants are enough to cook all the meals. They can work in following schedule:<br><br>1<sup>st</sup> assistant chooses interval [2,4] and cooks meals 2 and 4.<br><br>2<sup>nd</sup> assistant chooses interval [1,3] and cooks meals 1 and 3.<br><br>3<sup>rd</sup> assistant chooses interval [3,5] and cooks meal 5.<br><br>Other schedules can also be possible.</p>
