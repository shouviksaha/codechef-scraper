The Olympic Games, world's foremost sports competition,<br>
will be hosted by London next month.<br>
Tens of thousands of participants from over 200 nations will be participating this year.<br>
Each game has only 3 winners, so the organizers have decided to give special chocolate gift pack to each participant.</p>
<p align="justify">
A huge number of chocolates have just arrived from <b>N</b> different villages, numbered 1 to <b>N</b>.<br>
The organizers have decided the number of chocolates to be given to each participant.<br>
This is given in <b>count</b>, where <b>count</b>[<i>i</i>] is the number of chocolates from <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> village,<br>
to be placed in each gift pack.<br>
Now they need to order boxes for these chocolates.<br>
A box of size <b>S</b> can store at most <b>S</b> chocolates.<br>
A gift pack is made as follows.</p>
<p align="justify">
Each of the <b>N</b> villages is assigned a unique colored box<br>
and chocolates from a village are placed only in boxes assigned to it.<br>
The organizers always want to minimize the number of boxes in each gift pack.<br>
E.g., for given <b>N</b> = 3 villages and <b>count</b> = {3, 12, 7}, suppose colors assigned are <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>.<br>
If size of each box is <b>S</b> = 4, then we need 1 box of color A, 3 boxes of color B and 2 boxes of color C.<br>
All the boxes for a gift pack are then packed in a row using transparent wrapper.<br>
So in the above example, a gift pack can be "<i>ABBBCC</i>" or "<i>ABCBCB</i>" etc.</p>
<p align="justify">
To make everyone feel special, no two participants are given same gift packs.<br>
Two gift packs are different if and only if they have the different order of colored boxes, even in reverse order.<br>
For example "<i>ABBBCC</i>" is same as "<i>ABBBCC</i>" and also same as "<i>CCBBBA</i>".<br>
Given <b>Q</b> queries, each specifying the size of a box <b>S</b>,<br>
find the total number of different gift packs possible if we use boxes of size <b>S</b> each.<br>
Output the result modulo 1000000007 (10<sup>9</sup>+7).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p align="justify">The first line has an integer <b>N</b>. The second line has the array <b>count</b>, <b>N</b> space separated integers.<br>
The next line has integer <b>Q</b>, followed by <b>Q</b> lines, each having an integer size <b>S</b>.<br><br><br>
1 ≤ <b>N</b>, <b>count</b>[<i>i</i>], <b>Q</b> ≤ 100000 (10<sup>5</sup>)<br><br>
1 ≤ sum of all <b>count</b>[<i>i</i>] ≤ 100000 (10<sup>5</sup>)<br><br>
1 ≤ <b>S</b> ≤ 1000000000 (10<sup>9</sup>)<br><br></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p align="justify">Output <b>Q</b> lines, one for each query,<br>
the total number of different gift packs possible, using boxes of size <b>S</b>, specified in that query modulo 1000000007 (10<sup>9</sup>+7).</p>

</pre><p><br><br><br><b>Explanation:</b><br><br>
In the last query, size of each box <b>S</b> = 12.<br><br><br>
Suppose the colors assigned to the 3 villages are <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> respectively,<br>
we need 1 box of each color. <br><br><br>
Only 3 different gift packs can be made. They are "<i>ABC</i>", "<i>ACB</i>", "<i>BAC</i>".<br></p>
