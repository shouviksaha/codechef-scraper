ChefTown is the biggest city and the capital of ChefLand. There are N beautiful buildings: restaurants, museums, living houses with large kitchens and so on. Every building has its height. For every i (1&lt;=i&lt;=N) there is exactly one building with height i. The buildings are located in a single line from left to right. The height of ith building is H(i). The Mayor of ChefTown wants to organize a parade, where all great chefs will take part. A parade depends of its location. The location of a parade is a segment of consecutive buildings beginning near the building number L and ending near the building number R (1&lt;=L&lt;=R&lt;=N). Any parade won't be interesting if it is not hold on an interesting segment of buildings. The segment of buildings is interesting if following are hold:</p>
<ul><li>Imagine, that we have a segment [L,R].</li>
<li>Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment.</li>
<li>Let's sort B in non-decreasing order.</li>
<li>Segment [L,R] is interesting if B[i]-B[i-1]=1 for every i (2&lt;=i&lt;=K).</li>
</ul><p>
Now the Mayor of ChefTown is interested how many ways to organize an interesting parade of length W for ChefTown citizens. Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades ([L1,R1] and [L2,R2]) are considered to be different, if L1≠L2 or R1≠R2.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p> Each input file consists of two lines, the first one contains two integers N and W (1&lt;=N&lt;=400000, 1&lt;=W&lt;=N). The second line contains N numbers H(i) (1&lt;=i&lt;=N) - the heights of the buildings. </p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single integer - the number of interesting segments of buildings of length W.</p>
