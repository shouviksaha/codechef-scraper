<p>On the matrix A sized n×n, some cells were marked by crosses (X). For each cell (i,j) (with i – the row index, j – the column index), we define B(i,j) as the maximal number of continuous crosses “going across” the cell (i,j) in the same horizontal, vertical or diagonal; B(i,j)=0 if A(i,j) is empty ( '.' ).<br>
[ Empty cells are marked by '.'] .</p>
<p>
Clarification:<br>
Continuous crosses going across cell (i,j) in horizontal direction = x1 + x2 - 1<br>
where x1 = highest possible x such that<br>
          j + x - 1&lt;= n and A(i, j ... j + x - 1) are all 'X'<br>
and x2 = highest possible x such that<br>
          j - x + 1 &gt; 0  and A(i, j - x + 1...j) are all 'X'</p>
<p>Similarily we can extend the definition for vertical and diagonal directions.
</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given matrix A as input, calculate matrix B.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p></p><ul><li> The first line contains the integer n. </li>
<li> Then follow n lines , each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line represents the cell (i,j) of the matrix A, with A(i,j)='X' if it contains a cross, or A(i,j)='.' if it is empty. </li>
</ul><h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Output n lines, each contains n integers, the j-th integer of the i-th line shows the value of B(i,j).<br><b><em>(Each integer on a same line must be separated by exactly one space character)</em></b>
</p>
