<p><i>Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. </i>  </p>
<p>Our chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name.<br>
He believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky.   </p>
<p>Our chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -   </p>
<p> 1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7. <br>
 2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7. <br>
 3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4.  </p>
<p>Help our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the <b>smallest</b> Lucky lucky number having N digits. </p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
First line contains T, number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a number N, the number of digits in the Lucky lucky number to be formed.  </p>
<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=1000 <br>
1&lt;=N&lt;=1000000000 (10^9) </p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
If it is not possible to form a Lucky lucky number having N digits, output -1.<br>
Otherwise, output the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
5
7
4
11
1
15

<b>Output:</b>
7
0
7
-1
7

<b>Explanation</b>
For the last test case, N = 15, the smallest lucky lucky number is
444444477777777. The count of digit 4 is 7.
