<p>How to measure the difference between two strings? This is a midnight question of biological scientists. The number of pairs of different characters in the same position may be a good indicator. However, it will not work well in the case when two strings have different lengths. The longest common subsequence will also fail when strings are too long.</p>
<p>Recently, Professor of Math L.P.C. has invented the special method to deal with this problem. His invention has been known as a simple but creative solution: the difference is based on the number of substrings (a non-empty group of consecutive characters) of one string that are not substrings of the other string.</p>
<p>Let's learn about his invention. Call the first string as <b>A</b> and the second string as <b>B</b>. Let <b>S</b> be the set of all different substrings of <b>A</b>, and <b>T</b> be the set of all different substrings of <b>B</b>. We then define another set <b>P</b> which consists of all the strings that belongs to <b>S</b> or <b>T</b>, but not both. According to the Professor L.P.C. method, the size of <b>P</b> is a good indicator to measure the difference between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.</p>
<p>For example, let <b>A = aacd</b> and <b>B = cdaa</b>. We can see that:<br><b>S = {a, aa, aac, aacd, ac, acd, c, cd, d}</b>,<br><b>T = {c, cd, cda, cdaa, d, da, daa, a, aa}</b>,<br><b>P = {aac, aacd, ac, acd, cda, cdaa, da, daa}</b>.<br> Size of <b>P</b> is <b>8</b> and we can say the level of difference between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> is <b>8</b>. </p>
<p>Your task is to find this indicator.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input contains the string <b>A</b>. The second line contains the string <b>B</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output a single line containing the level of difference between strings <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> according to definition above.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>|A|</b> ≤ <b>100000</b>, where <b>|A|</b> denotes the length of the string <b>A</b></li>
<li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>|B|</b> ≤ <b>100000</b></li>
<li>Both <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> consist only of lowercase English letters (from 'a' to 'z')</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
