<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Dave recently mastered the problem of placing N queens on a chessboard so<br>
that no two queens attack eachother.<br>
Now he wants to see how many knights he can place on a chessboard so<br>
that no two knights attack eachother.<br>
Normally this would be a simple task, but some of the squares of the<br>
chessboard have been marked as unusable and hence cannot have a knight placed<br>
on them.</p>
<p>Recall that a knight can attack another knight if their vertical distance<br>
is 2 and their horizontal distance is 1, or if their vertical distance is 1 and<br>
their horizontal distance is 2.  Only one knight may be placed on each square<br>
of the chessboard</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (0&lt;T≤50), the number of test cases to follow.</p>
<p>Each test case will begin with a line containing 2 integers M and N (0&lt;M,N≤30),<br>
denoting the number of rows and columns, respectively.<br>
M lines follow, each containing exactly N characters.<br>
The j-th character of the i-th line is '.' if a knight may be placed in the j-th column of the i-th<br>
row, and '#' if the square is unusable.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a single line the maximum number of knights that may be placed<br>
on the chessboard such that no two attack eachother.</p>
<h3>Sample input:</h3>
<pre><code>2
2 4
....

5 5
..#..
#..#.

</code></pre><h3>Sample output:</h3>
