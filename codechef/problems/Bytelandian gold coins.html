<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.</p>
<p>
Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n<br>
can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4.<br>
But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).</p>
<p>
You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange<br>
rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.</p>
<p>
You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars<br>
you can get for it?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The input will contain several test cases (not more than 10). Each<br>
testcase is a single line with a number n, 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 1 000 000 000.<br>
It is the number written on your coin.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case output a single line, containing the maximum amount<br>
of American dollars you can make.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
12
2

<b>Output:</b>
13
2
</pre><p>
You can change 12 into 6, 4 and 3, and then change these into<br>
$6+$4+$3 = $13.</p>
<p>If you try changing the coin 2 into 3 smaller coins, you will get<br>
1, 0 and 0, and later you can get no more than $1 out of them.<br>
It is better just to change the 2 coin directly into $2.</p>
