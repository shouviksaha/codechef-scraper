<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>
The Chef is having a dinner party and invited over all his friends.  His guests<br>
being fairly health conscious have <strong>exact protein requirements</strong>, and The Chef wishes to oblige them all.</p>
<p>
The Chef will cook dishes for each individual guest using the ingredients in his kitchen.  Each ingredient has a specific amount of protein. The complete dish will have a protein content value equal to the sum of the protein<br>
contents of the individual ingredients. To cook a dish, The Chef can use any of the ingredients which appear on his shelf, <strong>but only in the order which they appear on the shelf</strong>.  The same ingredient may appear multiple times, and can also be used as many times as it appears.
</p>
<p>
There are multiple ways to choose ingredients following the rules given above. However, The Chef is only interested in choosing the set of ingredients that appear first in a <strong>lexicographically ordered</strong> list of ingredients which satisfy the protein constraints.  Your job is to write a program that helps The Chef figure out which dish to serve!
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains <tt><em>t</em></tt>, the number of guests invited by The Chef (about 200). </p>
<p>
Each test consists of three lines:</p>
<ul><li>The first line consists of one integer <tt>1 &lt;= <em>k</em> &lt;= 26</tt> (the number of <strong> unique </strong> ingredients on the shelf) and than <tt><em>k</em></tt><br>
space-separated positive integers from the set <tt>{1, 2, ... ,15}</tt> describing the protein content for each ingredient in an alphabetically sorted list of unique ingredients.  (the first protein value corresponds with ingredient <tt>a</tt>, the second corresponds with the protein value for ingredient <tt>b</tt>, and so on).
</li><li>The second line contains <em>L</em> - a sequence of lower-case letters of the Latin alphabet (at most 1000) which signify the name of the ingredient.
</li><li>The third line contains one positive integer S which specifies the exact protein requirement of this guest (<tt><em>1 &lt; S &lt; 500</em></tt>).
</li></ul><h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each testcase either output the sequence of ingredients as described above, or the word '<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>' if no such subsequence exists.</p>

<p><b>Comments:</b></p>
<p>For the first guest we have five ingredients: <tt>a, b, c, d, e</tt> with protein values <tt>12 1 12 4 4</tt> respectively. To achieve a total protein value equal to <tt>2</tt> we need two ingredients <tt>b</tt>. But there is only one, thus the answer is <tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.   </p>
<p>For the second guest we can achieve a total protein value of 15 with the ingredients taken as: <tt>abc, bca, acb, cab, cba, bac</tt>, or <tt>aaa</tt>. Of these, the first according to lexicographic order is <tt>aaa</tt>.</p>
<p>
For the third guest, out of the two possibilities, <tt>ab</tt> is the correct answer.   </p>
