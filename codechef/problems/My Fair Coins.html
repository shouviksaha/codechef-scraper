        There are coins of 2 different denominations in Crazyland, 1-cent coins and 2-cent coins. As all the coins do, even these coins have two faces, i.e. heads and tails.<br>
        Your task is to find out the the number of ways to create a linear arrangement of these coins so that their sum is <b>N </b>cents. The only condition on the linear arrangement is that<br>
        the first coin in the arrangement should always face heads. All other coins could either face head or face tail.<br><br></p>
<p>
        Take <b>N = 2</b> as an example. The possible arrangements are <b>(1H, 1H), (2H), (1H, 1T), </b>where <b>H</b> is heads and <b>T</b> is tails.<br>
        Therefore there are <b>3</b> possible arrangements that sum up to 2-cents.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Note</b>
    </p>
<p>
        While counting make sure that you count heads and tails as different.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Input</b>
    </p>
<p>
        First line contains <b>T</b>, the number of cases.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>T</b> lines follow, each containing a single number <b>N</b>, the required sum.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Constraints</b>
    </p>
<p>
        0 &lt;= <b>T </b>&lt;= 10000
    </p>
<p>
        1 &lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= 1000000000<b></b>
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Output</b>
    </p>
<p>
For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of such arrangements possible. As this can be very large print it modulo        <b>1000000007</b>.
