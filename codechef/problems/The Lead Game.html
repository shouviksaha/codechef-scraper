<p> The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around<br>
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our<br>
purposes this is sufficient.</p>
<p> The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players<br>
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds<br>
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by<br>
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher<br>
total score is declared the winner.</p>
<p> The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where<br>
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager<br>
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by<br>
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the<br>
end of each round the leader and her current lead are calculated. Once<br>
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the<br>
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
</p>
<pre>
    Round     Player 1       Player 2

      1             140                 82
      2              89                 134 
      3              90                 110 
      4              112              106
      5              88                  90 
</pre><p>
The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after<br>
each round for this game is given below:</p>
<pre>
    Round      Player 1       Player 2     Leader     Lead

      1               140           	 82        Player 1     58
      2               229           	216       Player 1     13
      3               319           	326       Player 2      7
      4               431           	432       Player 2      1
      5               519           	522       Player 2      3
</pre><p> The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58<br>
at the end of round 1) during the game.</p>
<p> Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning<br>
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will<br>
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.</p>
<p>Input</p>
<p> The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N<br>
≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines<br>
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.<br>
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1<br>
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤<br>
1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000.  </p>
<p>Output</p>
<p> Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers<br>
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the<br>
maximum lead attained by the winner.</p>
