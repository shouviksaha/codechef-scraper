<p>The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv currently is on the military mission. There are <b>N</b> enemy buildings placed in a row and numbered from left to right strating from <b>0</b>. Each building <b>i</b> (except the first and the last) has exactly two adjacent buildings with indices <b>i-1</b> and <b>i+1</b>. The first and the last buildings have just a single adjacent building.</p>
<p>Some of the buildings contain bombs. When bomb explodes in some building it destroys it and all adjacent to it buildings.</p>
<p>You are given the string <b>S</b> of length <b>N</b>, where <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> is <b>1</b> if the <b>i</b>-th building contains bomb, <b>0</b> otherwise. Find for the Little Elephant the number of buildings that will not be destroyed after all bombs explode. Please note that all bombs explode simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains single integer <b>T</b> - the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains the single integer <b>N</b> - the number of buildings. The next line contains the string <b>S</b> of length <b>N</b> consisted only of digits <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>In <b>T</b> lines print <b>T</b> inetgers - the answers for the corresponding test cases.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
