<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>It is well-known that the elephants are afraid of mouses. The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv is not an exception.</p>
<p>The Little Elephant is on a board <b>A</b> of <b>n</b> rows and <b>m</b> columns (0-based numeration). At the beginning he is in cell with coordinates <b>(0; 0)</b> and he wants to go to cell with coordinates <b>(n-1; m-1)</b>. From cell <b>(x; y)</b> Little Elephant can go either to <b>(x+1; y)</b> or <b>(x; y+1)</b>.</p>
<p>Each cell of the board contains either <b>1</b> or <b>0</b>. If <b>A[i][j] = 1</b>, then there is a single mouse in cell <b>(i; j)</b>. Mouse at cell <b>(i; j)</b> scared Little Elephants if and only if during the path there was at least one such cell <b>(x; y)</b> (which belongs to that path) and <b>|i-x| + |j-y| &lt;= 1</b>.</p>
<p>Little Elephant wants to find some correct path from <b>(0; 0)</b> to <b>(n-1; m-1)</b> such that the number of mouses that have scared the Little Elephant is minimal possible. Print that number.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p>First line contains single integer <b>T</b> - the number of test cases. Then <b>T</b> test cases follow. First line of each test case contain pair of integers <b>n</b> and <b>m</b> - the size of the board. Next <b>n</b> lines contain <b>n</b> strings, each of size <b>m</b> and consisted of digits <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>In <b>T</b> lines print <b>T</b> integer - the answers for the corresponding test.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>
<b>1</b> &lt;= <b>T</b> &lt;= <b>50</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>2</b> &lt;= <b>n, m</b> &lt;= <b>100</b></p>

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>

<p><b>Example case 1: </b><br>
The optimized path is: (0, 0) -&gt; (0, 1) -&gt; (0, 2) -&gt; (0, 3) -&gt; (0, 4) -&gt; (0, 5) -&gt; (0, 6) -&gt; (0, 7) -&gt; (0, 8) -&gt; (1, 8) -&gt; (2, 8). The mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (0, 2), (0, 8).
</p>
<p><b>Example case 2: </b><br>
The optimized path is: (0, 0) -&gt; (1, 0) -&gt; (1, 1) -&gt; (2, 1) -&gt; (2, 2) -&gt; (3, 2) -&gt; (3, 3) -&gt; (4, 3) -&gt; (4, 4) -&gt; (5, 4) -&gt; (5, 5) -&gt; (6, 5) -&gt; (6, 6) -&gt; (6, 7) -&gt; (6, 8). The 10 mouses that scared the Little Elephant are at the following cells: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 8).
