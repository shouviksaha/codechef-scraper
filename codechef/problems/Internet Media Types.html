<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Many internet protocols these days include the option of associating a<br>
media type with the content being sent.<br>
The type is usually inferred from the file extension.<br>
You are to write a program that facilitates the lookup of media types for<br>
a number of files.</p>
<p>You will be given a table of media type associations that associate a certain<br>
file extension with a certain media type.<br>
You will then be given a number of file names, and tasked to determine the correct<br>
media type for each file.<br>
A file extension is defined as the part of the file name after the final period.<br>
If a file name has no periods, then it has no extension and the media type cannot<br>
be determined.<br>
If the file extension is not present in the table, then the media type cannot be<br>
determined.<br>
In such cases you will print "unknown" as the media type.<br>
If the file extension does appear in the table (case matters), then print the associated<br>
media type.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input begins with 2 integers N and Q on a line.<br>
N is the number of media type associations, and Q is the number of file names.<br>
Following this are N lines, each containing a file extension and a media type, separated by a space.<br>
Finally, Q lines, each containing the name of a file.</p>
<p>N and Q will be no greater than 100 each.<br>
File extensions will consist only of alphanumeric characters, will have length at most 10, and will be distinct.<br>
Media types will have length at most 50, and will contain only alphanumeric characters and punctuation.<br>
File names will consist only of alphanumeric characters and periods and have length at most 50.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each of the Q file names, print on a line the media type of the file.<br>
If there is no matching entry, print "unknown" (quotes for clarity).</p>
