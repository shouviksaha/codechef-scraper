<p>In PrimeLand, there existed a very handsome young prince named <em>Prima</em>. He greatly desired the Princess of Mathematics â€“ <em>Facie</em>. However, before accepting his hand in marriage, Facie asked Prima to solve the following problem:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
The figure below shows a simple multiplication problem. However, not all the decimal digits are available. Prima has to find an assignment of digits to the marked places so that the multiplication is valid.</p>
<p></p><pre>
      * * *
   x    * *
    -------
      * * *         &lt;-- partial product 1
    * * *           &lt;-- partial product 2
    -------
    * * * *
</pre><p><br></p>
<p>Digits can appear only in places marked by  *'. Of course, leading zeroes are not allowed.<br>
Write a program to help Prima that will find all solutions to this problem for any subset of digits from the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains N, the number of digits that will be used <br><br>
The second line contains N space separated digits </p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single line with the total number of unique solutions. Here is the single solution for the sample input:</p>
