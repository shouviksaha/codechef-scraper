<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>A wireless network has been built consisting of many wireless access points for computers.<br>
Each access point can support a certain number of computers, and the network will perform better<br>
when computers are close to the access points supporting them.<br>
Specifically, the greatest distance between any computer and its access point determines the<br>
strength of the network.<br>
A network has recently been designed that will automatically reconfigure itself every time a computer<br>
is added so that the greatest distance will be as small as possible.<br>
Your task is to compute, as each computer is added to the network, this distance.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:<br>
There are 2 access points, at (5,5) and (6,9), each of which can support 2 computers.<br>
The first computer to be added to the wireless network is at (3,5).<br>
This computer connects to the access point at (5,5), which is only a distance of 2 away.<br>
The next computer to be added is at (5,2).<br>
This computer also connects to the access point at (5,5), and the greatest distance is now 3.<br>
A third computer is added at (4,2).<br>
This computer cannot connect to the (5,5) access point because it has already reached its limit.<br>
But connecting to (6,9) is not a good choice either because its so far away.<br>
Instead, the network reassigns the (3,5) computer to the (6,9) access point so that the new computer<br>
can connect to the (5,5) access point.<br>
The greatest distance is now from the (3,5) computer to the (6,9) access point, which is 5.<br>
(Note: in the picture below, the top-left corner is (0,0)).</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases to follow.<br>
Each test case begins with a line containing 2 integers, S (the number of access points)<br>
and C (the number of computers).  S+C lines follow.  The first S lines contain 3 integers each,<br>
giving the coordinates of an access point, followed by the number of connections it can support.<br>
The next C lines contain 2 integers each, giving the coordinates of a computer.<br>
There is a blank line before each test case.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output C lines, where the i'th line contains the greatest distance<br>
in the network after the first i computers have been added to the network, rounded to 3 decimal places.<br>
Output a blank line after each test case.</p>
