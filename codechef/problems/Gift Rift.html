<p>
Our Chef is very happy that his son was selected for training in one of the finest culinary schools of the world.<br>
So he and his wife decide to buy a gift for the kid as a token of appreciation.<br>
Unfortunately, the Chef hasn't been doing good business lately, and is in no mood on splurging money.<br>
On the other hand, the boy's mother wants to buy something big and expensive.<br>
To settle the matter like reasonable parents, they play a game.
</p>
<p>
They spend the whole day thinking of various gifts and write them down in a huge matrix.<br>
Each cell of the matrix contains the gift's cost.<br>
Then they decide that the mother will choose a row number <b>r</b> while the father will choose a column number <b>c</b>,<br>
the item from the corresponding cell will be gifted to the kid in a couple of days.
</p>
<p>
The boy observes all of this secretly.<br>
He is smart enough to understand that his parents will ultimately choose a gift whose cost is <b>smallest</b> in its <b>row</b>,<br>
but <b>largest</b> in its <b>column</b>.<br>
If no such gift exists, then our little chef has no option but to keep guessing.<br>
As the matrix is huge, he turns to you for help.
</p>
<p>
He knows that sometimes the gift is not determined uniquely even if a gift exists whose cost is smallest in its row,<br>
but largest in its column.<br>
However, since the boy is so smart, he realizes that the gift's <b>cost</b> is determined <b>uniquely</b>.<br>
Your task is to tell him the gift's <b>cost</b> which is smallest in its row,<br>
but largest in its column, or to tell him no such gift exists.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains two integers <b>R</b> and <b>C</b>, the number of rows and columns in the matrix respectively. Then follow <b>R</b> lines, each containing <b>C</b> space separated integers - the costs of different gifts.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p> Print a single integer - a value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but highest in its column. If no such value exists, then print "GUESS" (without quotes of course) </p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p> 1 &lt;= <b>R</b>, <b>C</b> &lt;= 100 </p>
<p> All gift costs are positive and less than 100000000 (10^8) </p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
2 3
9 8 8
2 6 11

<b>Output:</b>
8
</pre><h3>Example 2</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3 3
9 8 11
2 6 34
5 9 11

<b>Output:</b>
GUESS
</pre><h3>Example 3</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
2 2
10 10
10 10

<b>Output:</b>
10
</pre><h3>Explanation of Sample Cases</h3>
<p><b>Example 1</b>: The first row contains 9, 8, 8. Observe that both 8 are the minimum. Considering the first 8, look at the corresponding column (containing 8 and 6). Here, 8 is the largest element in that column. So it will be chosen.</p>
<p><b>Example 2</b>: There is no value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but largest in its column.</p>
<p><b>Example 3</b>: The required gift in matrix is not determined uniquely, but the required cost is determined uniquely.</p>
