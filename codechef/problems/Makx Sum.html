Did you know that the Hindus believe there are 330 million deities ? Lets discuss about them in long contests. The three main forces of god Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, also called Trimurti ( 3 forms ), want to decide when to end the world. Given an array A, which contains the 'Good' ( or 'Evil' ) score of each place on earth, they can easily find the maximum sum of the scores of a (contiguous) sub-array of places. But this is not much useful to them. So, <i>each</i> of them gives a value K and want to know the Kth maximum sum of scores of a contiguous sub-array. In other words, find the value of S[K] (1-based index), where the array S contains the sums of all possible contiguous sub-arrays in non-increasing order.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p align="justify">
First line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains N K1 K2 K3. Next line contains N space separated integers.<br></p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p align="justify">
For each test case, output the K1<sup>th</sup>, K2<sup>th</sup> and K3<sup>th</sup> maximum sum in a single line, separated by a single space. See sample cases and explanation for more clarity.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p align="justify">
1 ≤ T ≤ 3<br>
2 ≤ N ≤ 10000<br>
1 ≤ K1 &lt; K2 &lt; K3 ≤ 2012<br>
K3 ≤ N*(N+1)/2<br>
-10000 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10000</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
3 1 2 3
10 20 30
3 3 4 6
10 20 30
4 2 6 10
20 -15 10 -15

<b>Output:</b>
60 50 30
30 30 10
15 -5 -20
</pre><p>
<b>Explanation:</b><br>
Case 1 &amp; 2 : A = { 10, 20, 30 }. All possible sums of sub-arrays in non-increasing order, S[1..6] = { 60, 50, 30, 30, 20, 10 }</p>
