<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>The chef is a fan of candies with chocolate and caramel, and has devoted much of his life<br>
to finding the perfect ratio of chocolate to caramel.<br>
He recently discovered the perfect ratio, but to his dismay,<br>
none of his favourite candy shoppes sell candies with exactly that ratio.<br>
So the chef crafted a plan to buy several candies, and melt them together into a larger candy<br>
so that the resulting candy will have the perfect ratio.<br>
How many candies will he have to buy?<br>
The chef may buy multiple candies of the same type.
</p>
<h3>Input:</h3>
<p>Input begins with an integer N,<br>
the number of different candies available at the various shoppes.<br>
N lines follow, each containing 2 integers Chocolate<sub>i</sub> and Caramel<sub>i</sub> indicating the grams of chocolate and caramel,<br>
respectively, contained in the (i)th candy.<br>
Finally, there is a line containing 2 integers desiredChocolate and desiredCaramel, indicating the chef's desired ratio of<br>
chocolate to caramel.</p>
<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a single line the minimum number of candies the chef will have to buy.<br>
If it is impossible to produce a candy with the desired ratio, output -1 instead.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><b>Input 1:</b></p>
<pre>3
4 5
2 4
4 1
1 1
 </pre>
<p><b>Output 1:</b></p>
<pre>3
 </pre>
<p>In this example, the chef purchases one of each candy and combines them to form a candy with 8 grams chocolate and 8 grams caramel.</p>
<p><b>Input 2:</b></p>
<pre>3
2 3
4 6
10 15
5 8
 </pre>
<p><b>Output 2:</b></p>
<pre>-1
 </pre>
<h3>Constraints:</h3>
<p>1 ≤ N ≤ 15<br>
1 ≤ Chocolate<sub>i</sub> ≤ 500<br>
1 ≤ Caramel<sub>i</sub> ≤ 500<br>
1 ≤ desiredChocolate ≤ 500<br>
1 ≤ desiredCaramel ≤ 500<br>
For all candies, Chocolate<sub>i</sub>/Caramel<sub>i</sub> ≠ desiredChocolate/desiredCaramel<br>
No two candies will be identical.
