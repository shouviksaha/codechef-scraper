<p style="text-align:justify">Chef is playing a game on a sequence of <b>N</b> positive integers, say <b>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ... A<sub>N</sub></b>. The game is played as follows.</p>
<ul><li>If all the numbers are equal, the game ends.</li>
<li>Otherwise
<ul><li>Select two numbers which are unequal</li>
<li>Subtract the smaller number from the larger number</li>
<li>Replace the larger number with the result from above</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p style="text-align:justify">Chef has already figured out that the game <b>always terminates</b>. He also knows, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the <b>same value</b>, no matter how the game is played. Chef wants you to simulate the game for him and tell him if the game terminates on <b>1</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In fact, there may be many such games. Given a sequence of integers Chef wants to know the number of <b>sub-sequences</b> of the given sequence, for which, playing the above game on the subsuquence will terminate on <b>1</b>. A <b>sub-sequence</b> can be obtained from the original sequence by <b>deleting 0 or more</b> integers from the original sequence. See the explanation section for clarity.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Then follow the description of <b>T</b> test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b>, the length of the sequence. The second line contains <b>N</b> positive integers, each separated by a single space.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify">For each test case, <b>output a single integer</b> - the number of <b>sub-sequences</b> of the original sequence, such that, playing the game on the <b>sub-sequence</b> results in ending the game with all the values equal to <b>1</b>.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><b>1 ≤ T ≤ 100</b><br><b>1 ≤ N ≤ 60</b><br><b>1 ≤ A<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>4</sup></b><br><b>All A<sub>i</sub> will be distinct.</b></p>
