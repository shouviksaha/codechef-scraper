<p>
Chef's brother likes to put words in Chef's mouth.<br>
Chef hates it about him of course.<br>
He has decided to become extremely careful about what he speaks.<br>
Fortunately, he knows how his brother transforms the words, that Chef uses.<br>
He has decided to use only those words which remain the same even after his brother's transformation!</p>
<p>
If Chef speaks an N letter word, his brother moves all the letters which are at even positions (assuming, numbering of positions starts from 1), to the beginning of the word; and the rest of the letters follow as they appeared in the word. Eg. abdef becomes beadf; cdcd becomes ddcc.</p>
<p>Chef wants to know how many words can he use, provided that each word is composed of exactly N lowercase letters of the English alphabet. They use an ancient language in Byteland, which allows all possible words within the above definition!</p>
<p>Input format</p>
<p>
The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines, T test cases follow. Every test case is a single line, that contains a single positive integer, N,<br>
which is the length of the words that Chef wants to use.</p>
<p>Output format</p>
<p>
For each test case, print the number of words of length N that Chef can use; that is, number of words, which remain the same after brother's transformation.<br>
Since the result can be quite large, output the result modulo 1000000007.</p>
<p>Constraints</p>
