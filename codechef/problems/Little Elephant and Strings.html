<p>A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes <i>lucky strings</i>, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p>The Little Elephant has <b>K</b> favorite lucky strings <b>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>K</sub></b>. He thinks that the lucky string <b>S</b> is <i>good</i> if either <b>|S|</b> ≥ <b>47</b> or for some <b>j</b> from <b>1</b> to <b>K</b> we have that <b> A<sub>j</sub></b> is a substring of <b>S</b>.</p>
<p>The Little Elephant has found <b>N</b> lucky strings <b>B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, ..., B<sub>N</sub></b> under the pillow. Now he wants to know which of them are good. Help him and find for each <b>i</b> from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b> whether the string <b>B<sub>i</sub></b> is good or not.</p>
<p><b>Notes.</b></p>
<p>Let <b>S</b> be some lucky string. Then</p>
<ul><li><b>|S|</b> denotes the length of the string <b>S</b>;
</li>
<li><b>S[i]</b> (<b>1 ≤ i ≤ |S|</b>) denotes the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> character of <b>S</b> (the numeration of characters starts from <b>1</b>);
</li>
<li>The string <b>T</b> of the length <b>M</b> is called a <i>substring</i> of <b>S</b> if for some <b>k</b> from <b>0</b> to <b>|S| - M</b> we have <br><b>T[1] = S[k + 1], T[2] = S[k + 2], ..., T[M] = S[k + M]</b>.
</li>
</ul><h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input file contains two integers <b>K</b> and <b>N</b>, the number of favorite lucky strings of the Little Elephant and the number of strings he has found under the pillow. Each of the following <b>K</b> lines contains one favorite lucky string. Namely, <b>j</b><sup>th</sup> line among these <b>K</b> lines contains the string <b>A<sub>j</sub></b>. Each of the following <b>N</b> lines contains one lucky string that was found under the pillow. Namely, <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> line among these <b>N</b> lines contains the string <b>B<sub>i</sub></b>. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each of the <b>N</b> strings that were found under the pillow print <b>Good</b> if it is good, and <b>Bad</b> otherwise.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>1 ≤ <b>K, N</b> ≤ 50
</p>
<p>For each string <b>S</b> in the input file we have 1 ≤ <b>|S|</b> ≤ 50.
</p>
<p>Each string in the input file consists only of the lucky digits <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>

<b>Input:</b>
2 4
47
744
7444
447
7774
77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774

<b>Output:</b>
Good
Good
Bad
Good

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>The string <b>S = 7444</b> is good since the favorite string <b>744</b> is its substring.</p>
<p>The string <b>S = 447</b> is good since the favorite string <b>47</b> is its substring.</p>
<p>The string <b>S = 7774</b> is bad since none of the favorite strings <b>47</b> and <b>744</b> is a substring of <b>S</b>.</p>
<p>The string <b>S = 77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774</b> is good since its length is <b>47</b>. Note, however, that <b>S</b> does not have favorite substrings at all.</p>
