Some of the secret doors contain a very interesting word puzzle. The team of<br>
archaeologists has to solve it to open  that doors. Because there is no<br>
other way to open the doors, the puzzle is very important for us.</p>
<p align="justify">
There is a large number of magnetic plates on every door. Every plate has one<br>
word written on it. The plates must be arranged into a sequence in such a way that<br>
every word begins with the same letter as the previous<br>
word ends. For example, the word ``ac<u>m</u>'' can be followed by the word<br>
``<u>m</u>otorola''. Your<br>
task is to write a computer program that will read the list of words and<br>
determine whether it is possible to arrange all of the plates in<br>
a sequence (according to the given rule) and consequently to open the door.</p>
<p></p><h3>Input</h3>

<p align="justify">The input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T, equal to about 500) is given on<br>
the first line of the input file.<br>
Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer number N that indicates the number of plates<br>
(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000). Then exactly Nlines follow,<br>
each containing a single word. Each word contains at least two<br>
and at most 1000 lowercase characters, that means only letters '<code>a</code>'<br>
through '<code>z</code>' will appear in the word. The same word may appear several<br>
times in the list.</p>
<p></p><h3>Output</h3>

<p align="justify">Your program has to determine whether it is possible to arrange all the plates in<br>
a sequence such that the first letter of each word is equal to the last<br>
letter of the previous word. All the plates from the list must be used, each<br>
exactly once. The words mentioned several times must be<br>
used that number of times.</p>
<p align="justify">
If there exists such an ordering of plates, your program should print<br>
the sentence "<code>Ordering is possible.</code>". Otherwise, output<br>
the sentence "<code>The door cannot be opened.</code>".</p>
<p></p><h3>Example</h3>
