<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Chef has prepared a large number of unique dishes for a fancy dinner.<br>
Patrons from all over the world are interested in purchasing tickets for the dinner.<br>
Each interested patron has specified 2 dishes that they are interested in eating for dinner.<br>
As long as a patron is served at least one of their 2 preferred dishes, they will be happy.<br>
Chef wants to sell as many tickets as possible while being able to guarantee that all patrons are happy.<br>
Unfortunately, Chef has no control over who buys the tickets, only how many will be sold.<br>
How many tickets can Chef sell?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case begins with 2 integers N and M,<br>
the number of dishes and number of patrons, respectively.<br>
M lines follow, each containing 2 distinct integers between 1 and N, inclusive.<br>
The numbers on the i-th line represent the preferred dishes of the i-th patron.<br>
Each test case is followed by a blank line.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output a single integer indicating the maximum number of tickets<br>
Chef can sell while still being able to guarantee that every patron will be happy no matter which patrons buy tickets.</p>
