<p>Chef is good at making pancakes. Generally he gets requests to serve <b>N </b>pancakes at once.<br>
He serves them in the form of a stack.<br>
A pancake can be treated as a circular disk with some radius.</p>
<p>Chef needs to take care that when he places a pancake on the top of the stack the radius of the pancake should not exceed the radius of the largest pancake in the stack by more than <b>1</b>.<br>
Additionally all radii should be positive integers, and the bottom most pancake should have its radius asÂ <b>1</b>.<br>
Chef wants you to find out in how many ways can he create a stack containing <b>N</b> pancakes.</p>
<p><b>Input</b></p>
<p>First line of the input contains <b>T (T &lt;= 1000) </b>denoting the number of test cases.</p>
<p><b>T </b>lines follow each containing a single integer <b>N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) </b>denoting the size of the required stack.</p>
<p><b>Output</b></p>
<p>For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways a stack of size <b>N</b> can be created. As the answer can be large print it modulo <b>1000000007</b>.</p>
