Long ago there was a beautiful kingdom in the island of Sona, the golden island, deep inside Africa.<br>
The trees in Sona island are made of gold and farmers are the richest group of people and are also heavy tax payers.</p>
<p align="justify">
As you know that price of gold increases every year, the minister of Sona has proposed the following tax policy.</p>
<ul><li>Pay <b>initTax</b> units of gold in the first year.
</li>
<li>In each of the next <b>slot1</b> years, pay one unit of gold more than the previous year.
</li>
<li>In each of the next <b>slot2</b> years, pay double the units of gold of the previous year.
</li>
<li>In each of the following years, pay number of gold units equal to the product of the number of units paid in <b>K</b> recent years.
</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Given an integer <b>N</b>, find the number of units of gold to be paid in the <b>N</b><sup>th</sup> year. This result can be huge, so output the result modulo 100000007 (10<sup>8</sup>+7).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p align="justify">First line has an integer <b>T</b> (number of test cases, 1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 3). Each of the next <b>T</b> lines has 5 integers, <b>initTax slot1 slot2 K N</b>.<br>
1 ≤ <b>initTax</b>, <b>slot1</b>, <b>slot2</b> ≤ 50<br>
1 ≤ <b>K</b> ≤ <b>slot1</b> + <b>slot2</b> + 1<br>
1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 1000000000 (10<sup>9</sup>)</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p align="justify">For each test case, output the tax in units of gold to be paid in the <b>N</b><sup>th</sup> year modulo 100000007  (10<sup>8</sup>+7).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
1 3 2 4 4
1 3 2 4 7
1 3 2 4 9

<b>Output:</b>
4

</pre><p>
<b>Explanation:</b></p>
<p>Let tax[i] be the tax paid in i<sup>th</sup> year.</p>
<p>Init : tax[1] = 1</p>
<p>Next 3 years in slot1 (tax[i] = tax[i-1] + 1) : tax[2] = 2 , tax[3] = 3, tax[4] = 4</p>
<p>Next 2 years in slot2 (tax[i] = 2 * tax[i-1]) : tax[5] = 8 , tax[6] = 16</p>
<p>We have tax[1..6] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16 }</p>
<p>tax[7] = tax[3] * tax[4] * tax[5] * tax[6] = 3 * 4 * 8 * 16 = 1536</p>
<p>similarly, tax[9] = tax[5] * tax[6] * tax[7] * tax[8].</p>
<p>Do not forget to print only the reminder of the result when divided by 100000007 (10<sup>8</sup>+7).</p>
