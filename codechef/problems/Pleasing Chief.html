<p style="text-align:justify">Chef's girlfriend, Chief, is displeased with him. This is not a good sign for their<br>
	relationship, and as always, he has turned to you for help. He looks forward to take his girlfriend to shopping;<br>
	offering her to buy 'K' gifts. The shop that he is taking her to has 'N' unique items, that is,<br>
	there is single quantity of each item (its a very special shop, you see!).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Chef has with him, K discount coupons that he wishes to use. The shop's policy<br>
	only allows Chef to use one discount coupon on any one purchased item. That is why Chef is letting Chief buy K<br>
	gifts; he intends to use each coupon with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Chef of course cannot stop Chief from buying whatever she likes. Chief would select any K<br>
	gifts, from among the N items that the shop has. She makes selection of any K out of N items, uniformly. Suppose,<br>
	there are 5 items and Chef lets Chief buy 3, then she selects any of the 3 out of 5 items with the probability 1/10.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">After Chief selects the items she wishes to buy, Chef will have to pay the bill. Smart as he<br>
	is, he would apply the K discount coupons on the K items (one on each) such that the discount he receives is as large<br>
	as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Chef wants to prepare himself for this day. He knows beforehand the price of each item<br>
	in the shop. Can you tell him what expected discount can he expect? You have to tell him the expected discount<br>
	in the amount of money he can expect to save.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold">Input format</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines,<br>
	T test cases follow (without any newlines between them.)<br>
Each case consists of only 3 lines.<br>
The first line of each test case contains N and K, separated by a single space.<br>
The second line contains N positive integers, the prices of the N items respectively, separated by a single space.<br>
The third line contains K positive integers (between 1 and 100, inclusive) separated by a single space. They represent<br>
the percentage of discount offered by the coupons, that Chef has, respectively.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold">Output format</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For each test case, print the expected amount of money Chef should expect to save.<br>
	Output the result rounded to 3 digits after the decimal.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In the second case, Chief can make the following selections:</p>
<ul><li>(100, 200, 300), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 140.</li>
<li>(100, 200, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 170.</li>
<li>(100, 300, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 190.</li>
<li>(200, 300, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 200.</li>
</ul><p style="text-align:justify">Thus Chef can save an expected (140 + 170 + 190 + 200) / 4 = 175.000</p>
