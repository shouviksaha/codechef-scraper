<p style="text-align:justify">Chef loves that his cooks involve themselves in group activities.<br>
	This month, Chef has involved his cooks in a rather very curious game.<br>
	It involves all his cooks, standing in a circle. Each cook is given one integer to keep,<br>
	which may be positive or negative (or zero).<br>
	The sum of all the integers, given to the cooks, is positive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Suppose there are N (N ≥ 3) cooks. Cooks are labeled from 1 to N.<br>
	k's neighbors are (k-1) and (k+1), as they are standing in a circle.<br>
	Note that if k = 1, k-1 wraps around to N; and if k = N, k+1 wraps around to 1.<br>
	Let A[i] represent the integer that is kept by the cook i.<br>
	The game proceeds in turns. In each turn, any one cook may opt to play.<br>
	Now, suppose the cook k wants to play in this turn, the following changes happen, in the given order:</p>
<ul><li>A[k-1] = A[k-1] + A[k]</li>
<li>A[k+1] = A[k+1] + A[k]</li>
<li>A[k] = -A[k]</li>
</ul><p style="text-align:justify">The game would end as soon as all the numbers kept by the cooks (each A[i]) is non-negative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Cooks are very impatient people!<br>
	They want to end the game as quickly as possible!<br>
	Help them determine a sequence in which they must play, such that the number of turns in which<br>
	the game finishes, is as low as possible.<br>
	For the purpose of this problem, you are to find the minimum number of turns in which the game can end!</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold">Input format</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines, T test cases follow (without any newlines between them.) Each test case consists of exactly two lines.<br>
The first line contains the only positive integer N, the number of cooks playing the game. The second line contains N space separated integers, the initial numbers kept by the cooks.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold">Output format</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">For each test case, print the minimum number of turns in which the game can end.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In the first case, cook 2 can take the first turn which converts the sequence into<br>
	(0, 1, 1) and end the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the second case, the following sequence of moves are optimal.</p>
<ul><li>0. (4, -2, -1) -- initial</li>
<li>1. (3, -3, 1) -- after cook 3 moves</li>
<li>2. (0,  3, -2) -- after cook 2 moves</li>
<li>3. (-2, 1, 2) -- after cook 3 moves</li>
<li>4. (2, -1, 0) -- after cook 1 moves</li>
<li>5. (1, 1, -1) -- after cook 2 moves</li>
<li>6. (0, 0, 1) -- after cook 3 moves</li>
