<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the growing population, <b>Archer</b> was asked to come up with a plan. <b>Archer</b> being as intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan:</p>
<p>If <b>N</b> children, with names <b>C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, ..., C<sub>N</sub></b>, are born to parents with names <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, and you consider <b>C</b> to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation">concatenation</a> of all the names of the children, i.e. <b>C = C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> + ... + C<sub>N</sub></b> (where <b>+</b> is concatenation operator), then <b>C</b> should be a substring of one of the permutations of <b>A + B</b>.</p>
<p>You are given the task to verify whether the names parents propose to give their children are in fact permissible by Archer's plan or not.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow. Each test case stats with a line containing two space separated strings <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoting the names of the parents. The next line contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of children <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are planning to have. Following this are <b>N</b> lines, the <b>i'th</b> line containing <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>, the proposed name for the <b>i'th</b> child.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case output a single line containing <code>"YES"</code> if the names are permissible by Archer's plan, otherwise print <code>"NO"</code>. (quotes are meant for clarity, please don't print them)</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<ul><li><b> 1 ≤  T ≤ 100 </b></li>
<li><b> 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000 </b></li>
<li><b> The lengths of all the strings including A, B, and all C<sub>i</sub> will be in the range [1, 40000], both inclusive. All these strings will contain only lowercase English letters.</b></li>
<li><b>The combined lengths of all names of children will not exceed the combined length of the names of their parents.</b></li>
</ul><h3>Example</h3>
<pre><b>Input:</b>
3
tom marvoloriddle
2
lord
voldemort
cheap up
1
heapcup
bruce wayne
2
bat
man

<b>Output:</b>
YES
YES
NO
</pre><h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Let <b>Y</b> denote the concatenation of names of all the children, and <b>X</b> denote the concatenation of the names of the parents.</p>
<p> <b>Case 1:</b> Here <b>X = "tommarvoloriddle"</b>, and <b>Y = "lordvoldemort"</b>. Consider <b>Z = "iamlordvoldemort"</b>. It is not difficult to see that <b>Z</b> is a permutation of <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> is a substring of <b>Z</b>. Hence <b>Y</b> is a substring of a permutation of <b>X</b>, so the answer is "YES".</p>
<p> <b>Case 2:</b> Here <b>X = "cheapup"</b>, and <b>Y = "heapcup"</b>. Since <b>Y</b> in itself is a permutation of <b>X</b>, and as every string is a substring of itself, <b>Y</b> is a substring of <b>X</b> and also a permutation of <b>X</b>. Hence "YES".</p>
<p> <b>Case 3:</b> Here <b>X = "brucewayne"</b>, and <b>Y = "batman"</b>. As "t" is not present in <b>X</b>, "t" wont be present in any permutation of <b>X</b>, hence the answer is "NO".</p>
