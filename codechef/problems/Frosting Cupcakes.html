<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Now that Chef has streamlined his cupcake baking procedure,<br>
he's turning his attention toward frosting the cupcakes.<br>
He recently purchased a machine that produces frosting.<br>
Each cupcake requires one unit of frosting, and the frosting machine<br>
requires K<sup>2</sup> units of energy to produce K units of frosting<br>
in one minute (K need not be an integer).<br>
Cupcakes arrive in batches, once per minute, needing frosting.<br>
The cupcakes must be frosted within a minute of when they arrive.<br>
The frosting machine also has a reserve unit, so it can produce extra frosting<br>
to be used later.<br>
The reserve unit has a capacity of S units of frosting, and is initially empty.<br>
The machine may produce more units of frosting than is currently demanded, and<br>
the excess will be added to the reserve unit.<br>
Or, the machine can produce fewer units of frosting than is currently demanded,<br>
drawing the remainder of what is needed from the reserve.<br>
At all times the reserve unit must have between 0 and S units of frosting.</p>
<p>
Chef has a schedule ahead of time of exactly how many cupcakes<br>
will arrive each minute needing frosting, and can create a frosting production schedule for the machine that will optimize its energy usage.  The machine may produce a different amount of frosting each minute.<br>
Given the cupcake schedule, calculate the minimum energy needed to frost all<br>
the cupcakes divided by the total number of cupcakes.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case begins with 2 integers N and S on a line, representing<br>
the number of minutes the machine will operate, and the capacity of the<br>
storage unit, respectively.<br>
Following is a line with N space-separated integers C<sub>0</sub>...C<sub>N-1</sub>,<br>
where C<sub>i</sub> is the number of cupcakes arriving at time i.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a single line the minimum total energy consumption<br>
of the machine divided by the total number of cupcakes, rounded to 5 places after the decimal point.</p>
