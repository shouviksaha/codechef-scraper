<p> As you might remember, the collector of Siruseri had ordered<br>
a complete revision of the Voters List. He knew that constructing<br>
the list of voters is a difficult task, prone to errors. Some<br>
voters may have been away on vacation, others may have moved<br>
during the enrollment and so on. </p>
<p> To be as accurate as possible, he entrusted the task to three different<br>
officials. Each of them was to independently record the list of voters and<br>
send it to the collector. In Siruseri, every one has a ID number and<br>
the list would only list the ID numbers of the voters and not their names.<br>
The officials were expected to arrange the ID numbers in ascending order<br>
in their lists. </p>
<p> On receiving the lists, the Collector realised that there were<br>
discrepancies - the three lists were not identical.  He decided<br>
to go with the majority. That is, he decided to construct the<br>
final list including only those ID numbers that appeared in at<br>
least 2 out of the 3 lists.  For example if the three lists<br>
were</p>
<pre>
23  30  42  57  90
21  23  35  57  90  92
21  23  30  57  90 
</pre><p>then the final list compiled by the collector would be:</p>
<pre>
21  23  30  57  90
</pre><p> The ID numbers 35, 42 and 92 which appeared in only one list<br>
each do not figure in the final list.</p>
<p> Your task is to help the collector by writing a program that<br>
produces the final list from the three given lists.</p>
<p>Input format</p>
<p>The first line of the input contains 3 integers<br><em>N</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub> and<br><em>N</em><sub>3</sub>.  <em>N</em><sub>1</sub> is the number of<br>
voters in the first list, <em>N</em><sub>2</sub> is the number of<br>
voters in the second list and <em>N</em><sub>3</sub> is the number of<br>
voters in the third list.  The next <em>N</em><sub>1</sub> lines<br>
(lines 2,...,<em>N</em><sub>1</sub>+1) contain one positive integer<br>
each and describe the first list in ascending order.  The following</p>
<p><em>N</em><sub>2</sub> lines (lines<br><em>N</em><sub>1</sub>+2,...,<em>N</em><sub>1</sub>+<em>N</em><sub>2</sub>+1)<br>
describe the second list in ascending order and the final<br><em>N</em><sub>3</sub> lines (lines</p>
<p><em>N</em><sub>1</sub>+<em>N</em><sub>2</sub>+2,...,<em>N</em><sub>1</sub>+<em>N</em><sub>2</sub>+<em>N</em><sub>3</sub>+1)<br>
describe the third list in ascending order.</p>
<p>Output format</p>
<p>The first line of the output should contain a single integer<br><em>M</em> indicating the number voters in the final list. The next<br><em>M</em> lines (lines 2,...,<em>M</em>+1) should contain one<br>
positive integer each, describing the list of voters in the final<br>
list, in ascending order.</p>
<p>Test data</p>
<p>You may assume that 1 ≤<br><em>N</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>N</em><sub>2</sub>,<em>N</em><sub>3</sub><br>
≤ 50000.
