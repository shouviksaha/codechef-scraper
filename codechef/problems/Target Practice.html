<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Chef has recently taken up marksmanship, but he's not very good at it.<br>
Chef has set up a number of targets in a line.<br>
When Chef shoots at a target, he may hit the target, but he may instead hit<br>
the target to the left, or the target to the right<br>
(or if there is no such target, miss completely).<br>
Chef knows the probability of his shot going straight, left, or right,<br>
and wants to hit each target at least once using as few shots as possible.</p>
<p>Help Chef determine the expected number of shots required, provided an optimal strategy is followed.<br>
Note that Chef may only shoot at targets, but may shoot at a target that's already been hit.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case will consist of 4 integers:<br>
N, the number of targets,<br>
L, the probability of the shot veering to the left,<br>
S, the probability of the shot going straight,<br>
and R, the probability of the shot veering to the right.<br>
L, S, and R are given as percents.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output the expected number of shots to hit all targets, rounded to 6 decimal places.
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>4
3 25 50 25
3 10 10 80
5 25 50 25
8 30 35 35
</pre><h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>4.666667
10.361111
7.541667
13.107725

</pre><p>In the first example, Chef shoots at the center target until any 2 targets have been hit,<br>
then he shoots at the remaining target.</p>
