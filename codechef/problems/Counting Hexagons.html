<p>Dexter wants to make a hexagon by using six sticks for sides from a collection of sticks of lengths <b>1, 2, 3, ... N</b>. Dexter will only make <b>valid</b> hexagons whose area is strictly positive.</p>
<p>He considers a hexagon "good" if the biggest stick has  <b>length at least L</b> and lengths of all the other sticks <b>are not more than X</b>.  A "good" hexagon does not have sticks of the <b>same length more than K times</b>. </p>
<p>How many ways he can make a "good" hexagon?</p>
<p>For example, when N=8, L=7, X=5, K=3: { 1,2,2,5,5,7 } is a good hexagon but {1,2,2,2,2,7}, { 1,2,3,4,5,6},{1,2,3,4,6,7} are not .</p>
<p>Two hexagons are considered different if their side length sets are different. For example {1,2,3,4,5,6} , {1,1,1,2,2,3} and {1,1,2,2,2,3} are all different </p>
<p>hexagons. But {1,2,3,4,5,6} and { 2,4,6,1,3,5} are not different.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p> Input contains four integers <b>N( 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^9)</b> , <b>L ( 2 &lt;= L &lt;= N</b> and <b>N-L&lt;=100)</b> , <b> X(  1&lt;=X&lt; L )</b> and<b> K ( 1 &lt;=  K &lt;= 5) </b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p> Output the number of different ways to make a "good" hexagon <b>% 1000000007.</b></p>
