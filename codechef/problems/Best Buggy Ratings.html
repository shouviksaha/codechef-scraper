<p align="justify">A rating system for cricket players is built by Mr.Bugs Bunny and as expected, it has lot of bugs. The initial ratings of N players  ( numbered 0 to N-1 ) are given and we refer it as array V<sub>0</sub>. The system is expected to answer simple queries of the form, find the top-2 maximum ratings among players from i to j ( inclusive ). Top-2 maximum means the first two elements of the ratings sorted in non-increasing order.<br>
Due to bugs in the system, an unexpected update occurs after output of each query and this creates a new version of the ratings array V. We refer the Kth version of the ratings arrays as V<sub>K</sub>. Also, for a query, the system queries on some previous version of V. Mr. Bunny gave the exact details of the bugs as follows,</p>
<p>Given Q queries numbered 1 to Q in order and values of A B C D M,</p>
<ul><li>For a query number K, the query is made on the array V<sub>t</sub> , where t = ( A * R1 + D ) % K, and R1 is the maximum rating in the query range of the previous query. For the first query, consider R1 = 0.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>For a query number K, let R1 and R2 be the top-2 maximum ratings ( R1 ≥ R2 ). After it outputs this answer, the system changes the rating of a player. Specifically, the rating of player number ( B * R1 + D ) % N is changed to ( C * R2 + D ) % M. This update is on the array V<sub>(K-1)</sub> and a new version V<sub>K</sub> is created.
</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p align="justify">You can not fix these bugs, but can you guess the output produced by this system. For more clarity, check the pseudo code below.</p>
<pre>
read array V<sub>0</sub>;
R1 = 0, R2 = 0;
for K = 1 to Q
     t = ( A * R1 + D ) % K
     read qi qj
     R1, R2 = top-2 Maximum ratings in range [qi..qj] in the array V<sub>t</sub>
     Output R1 R2
     V<sub>K</sub> = Update array V<sub>(K-1)</sub> by changing V<sub>(K-1)</sub> [ ( B * R1 + D ) % N ] = ( C * R2 + D ) % M
end-for
</pre><p>
<u>Note:</u> Take care of potential overflows in intermediate calculations in the equations mentioned above. The authors algorithm doesn't depend on the values of A B C D M, they are just used to generate some values.<br></p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p align="justify">First line contains 6 integers N M A B C D and the second line contains N integers, the initial ratings of N players in order ( 2 ≤ N, A, B, C, D ≤ 100,000 ;  0 ≤ V<sub>0</sub>[i] , M &lt; 1,000,000,000 ; M ≥ 2 ). Next line contains Q ( number of queries 1 ≤ Q ≤ 100,000 ), followed by Q lines. The Kth line in this has the query number K, and has two integers qi qj ( 0 ≤ qi &lt; qj &lt; N ).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p align="justify">For each query, output the top-2 maximum ratings R1 R2 ( R1 ≥ R2 ) in a new line.</p>
