<p>
Consider an infinitely large chess table.<br>
From the cell (0, 0), our knight has to move to the cell (<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>) by the rule:<br>
our knight could only move from a cell (<b>u</b>, <b>v</b>) to the cell (<b>u</b>+<b>A<sub>X</sub></b>, <b>v</b>+<b>A<sub>Y</sub></b>) or (<b>u</b>+<b>B<sub>X</sub></b>, <b>v</b>+<b>B<sub>Y</sub></b>) in one move.<br>
Note that it may be different from ordinary knight's move of chess.
</p>
<p>In addition, there is <b>K</b> blocked cell(s) on the table where the knight could not move on.</p>
<p>
Your task is to count how many distinct ways the knight could complete his mission.<br>
Two ways are called "distinct" if and only if they have different numbers of steps or there exists <b>i</b> such that they are in different cells after <b>i</b>-th step.<br>
Note that our knight may continue to move after he reaches the cell (<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>).
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The first line contains 3 integer <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, <b>K</b>.</li>
<li>The second line contains 4 integers <b>A<sub>X</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>Y</sub></b>, <b>B<sub>X</sub></b>, <b>B<sub>Y</sub></b>.</li>
<li>The third line contains <b>K</b> pair(s) of integers, each represents co-ordinate of a blocked cell. This line does not exist if <b>K</b> = 0.</li>
</ul><h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case, output on a line the number of ways found modulo 1000000007 (10<sup>9</sup>+7).<br>
If there are infinitely many ways, then output -1 instead.
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 5<br>
0 ≤ <b>K</b> ≤ 15<br>
The absolute values of all other input values are at most 500.<br>
(0, 0) is not a blocked cell.<br>
(<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>) is not a blocked cell.

<b>Explanations:</b>
</p>
<p>
In the first and second examples, our knight's move is the similar to ordinary knight's, but only 2 directions are allowed. In the first example, there are 2 ways (0, 0) -&gt; (1, 2) -&gt; (3, 3) and (0, 0) -&gt; (2, 1) -&gt; (3, 3).
</p>
<p>
In the third example, our knight's cannot move toward, so our knight's cannot complete his mission.
