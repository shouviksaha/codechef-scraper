<p> For two given sequences of integers, find the longest possible integer sequence which is a subsequence of both these sequences, and whose elements are integers in a (strictly) increasing order.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p> The first number is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), the length of the first sequence.</p>
<p> The next n integers are elements of the first sequence.</p>
<p> The next is m (1 ≤ m ≤ 5000), the length of the second sequence.</p>
<p> The next m integers are elements of the second sequence.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>One number k, the length of the longest possible common subsequence that is increasing, followed by exactly k space-separated integers containing any exemplary sequence of this length.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
