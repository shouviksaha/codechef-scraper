<p>
The bustling town of Siruseri has just one sports stadium. There<br>
are a number of schools, colleges, sports associations, etc. that<br>
use this stadium as the venue for their sports events. </p>
<p> Anyone interested in using the stadium has to apply to the Manager<br>
of the stadium indicating both the starting date (a positive integer<br>
S) and the length of the sporting event in days (a positive integer D)<br>
they plan to organise.  Since these requests could overlap it may not<br>
be possible to satisfy everyone.  </p>
<p>
It is the job of the Manager to decide who gets to use the<br>
stadium and who does not. The Manager, being a genial man, would like<br>
to keep as many organisations happy as possible and hence would<br>
like to allocate the stadium so that maximum number of events are held.
</p>
<p>
Suppose, for example, the Manager receives the following 4 requests:
</p>
<table><tr><td>Event No.</td>
<td>Start Date</td>
<td>Length</td>
</tr><tr><td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr><tr><td>2</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr><tr><td>3</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr><tr><td>4</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr></table><p>
He would allot the stadium to events 1, 4 and 3. Event 1 begins on day 2<br>
and ends on day 6, event 4 begins on day 9 and ends on day 11 and event<br>
3 begins on day 15 and ends on day 20. You can verify that it is not possible<br>
to schedule all the 4 events (since events 2 and 3 overlap  and only one of<br>
them can get to use the stadium).
</p>
<p>
Your task is to help the manager find the best possible allotment (i.e.,<br>
the maximum number of events that can use the stadium).
</p>
<p>Input format</p>
<p>
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N ≤ 100000)<br>
indicating the number of events for which the Manager has received a request.<br>
Lines 2,3,...,N+1  describe the requirements of the N events.<br>
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Di indicating the starting date<br>
and the duration of event i. You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤ 1000000 and<br>
1 ≤ Di ≤ 1000.</p>
<p>Output format</p>
<p>
Your output must consist of a single line containing a single integer M,<br>
indicating the maximum possible number of events that can use the stadium.
