To protect people from evil,<br>
a long and tall wall was constructed a few years ago.<br>
But just a wall is not safe, there should also be soldiers on it,<br>
always keeping vigil.<br>
The wall is very long and connects the left and the right towers.<br>
There are exactly <b>N</b> spots (numbered 1 to <b>N</b>) on the wall for soldiers.<br>
The <i>K</i><sup>th</sup> spot is <i>K</i> miles far from the left tower and (<b>N</b>+1-<i>K</i>) miles from the right tower.</p>
<p align="justify">
Given a permutation of spots <i>P</i> of {1, 2, ..., <b>N</b>}, soldiers occupy the <b>N</b> spots in that order.<br>
The <i>P</i>[<i>i</i>]<sup>th</sup> spot is occupied before the <i>P</i>[<i>i</i>+1]<sup>th</sup> spot.<br>
When a soldier occupies a spot, he is connected to his nearest soldier already placed to his left.<br>
If there is no soldier to his left, he is connected to the left tower. The same is the case with right side.<br>
A connection between two spots requires a wire of length equal to the distance between the two.</p>
<p align="justify">
The realm has already purchased a wire of <b>M</b> miles long from Nokia,<br>
possibly the wire will be cut into smaller length wires.<br>
As we can observe, the total length of the used wire depends on the permutation of the spots <i>P</i>. Help the realm in minimizing the length of the unused wire. If there is not enough wire, output -1.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p align="justify">First line contains an integer <b>T</b> (number of test cases, 1 ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ 10 ). Each of the next <b>T</b> lines contains two integers <b>N M</b>, as explained in the problem statement (1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 30 , 1 ≤ <b>M</b> ≤ 1000).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p align="justify">For each test case, output the minimum length of the unused wire, or -1 if the the wire is not sufficient.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
4
3 8
3 9
2 4
5 25

<b>Output:</b>
0
0
-1
5
</pre><p>
<b>Explanation:</b><br>
In the 1st case, for example, the permutation <i>P</i> = {2, 1, 3} will use the exact 8 miles wires in total.</p>
<p>In the 2nd case, for example, the permutation <i>P</i> = {1, 3, 2} will use the exact 9 miles wires in total.</p>
<p>To understand the first two cases, you can see the following figures:<br><img src="http://www.codechef.com/download/NOKIA1.png" width="500" height="683"></p>

<p>
In the 3rd case, the minimum length of wire required is 5, for any of the permutations {1,2} or {2,1}, so length 4 is not sufficient.</p>
<p>In the 4th case, for the permutation {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} we need the maximum length of the wire = 20. So minimum possible unused wire length = 25 - 20 = 5.</p>
