<i>Genjiko</i> is one of the Japanese traditional games.<br>
Chef Ciel will take place a variant version of genjiko in her restaurant.
</p>
<p>
The rules of the game are the following:
</p>
<ul><li>The challenger must be blindfolded.</li>
<li>Ciel feeds the challenger one of the <strong>N</strong> foods menus of her restaurant, <strong>M</strong> times.</li>
<li>The challenger must answer whether the <strong>i</strong>-th food and the <strong>j</strong>-th food are same or not, for all 1 ≤ <strong>i</strong> &lt; <strong>j</strong> ≤ <strong>M</strong>.</li>
<li>For making the game difficult, Ciel cannot use the same menu for both the <strong>i</strong>-th menu and the (<strong>i</strong>+<strong>j</strong>)-th menu for all 1 ≤ <strong>j</strong> ≤ <strong>K</strong>. (The challenger knows this)</li>
</ul><p>
Ciel wonders how many patterns can be the challenger's answer.<br>
Your task is calculating the number of the patterns modulo 1000000009 (10<sup>9</sup>+9).
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line contains an integer <strong>T</strong>, the number of test cases.<br>
Then <strong>T</strong> test cases follow.<br>
Each test case has 3 integers <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> and <strong>K</strong>.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Print the number of the patterns of the possible answers modulo 1000000009 (10<sup>9</sup>+9).
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1 ≤ <strong>T</strong> ≤ 100<br>
1 ≤ <strong>N</strong> ≤ 200<br>
1 ≤ <strong>M</strong> ≤ 1000000000 (10<sup>9</sup>)<br>
0 ≤ <strong>K</strong> ≤ 200

The first case is the same as genjiko.<br>
In the traditional game genjiko, we make connections between each possible answer and the name of a book of <i>The Tale of Genji</i>.<br>
However The Tale of Genji is composed of 54 books, so the names of the first book and the last book are unused.
</p>
<p>
Let the letters A, B, C, ... denote the <strong>N</strong> menus, and let "ABA" mean that Ciel uses A for the 1st food, and uses B for the 2nd food, and uses A for the 3rd food.<br>
In the second case, Ciel cannot use the same menu consecutively.<br>
So Ciel can use only 2 patterns "ABA" and "BAB".<br>
However there is only one possible answer [1st ≠ 2nd, 1st = 3rd, 2nd ≠ 3rd].
</p>
<p>
In the third case, Ciel can use 8 patterns "AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAA", "BAB", "BBA" and "BBB".<br>
And there are four possible answers [1st = 2nd, 1st = 3rd, 2nd = 3rd], [1st = 2nd, 1st ≠ 3rd, 2nd ≠ 3rd], [1st ≠ 2nd, 1st = 3rd, 2nd ≠ 3rd] and [1st ≠ 2nd, 1st ≠ 3rd, 2nd ≠ 3rd].
</p>
<p>
In the fifth case, Ciel can use no patterns.
