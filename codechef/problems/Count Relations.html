<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>Let A be a set of the first <b>N</b> positive integers :A={1,2,3,4.........N}<br><br>
Let B be the set containing all the subsets of A.</p>
<p>Professor Eric is a mathematician who defined two kind of relations R1 and R2 on set B.<br><br>
The relations are defined as follows:</p>
<p>R1={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B <b>and</b> x is not a subset of y <b>and</b> y is not a subset of x <b>and</b> the intersection of x and y is equal to empty set }</p>
<p>R2={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B <b>and</b> x is not a subset of y <b>and</b> y is not a subset of x <b>and</b> the intersection of x and y is not equal to empty set }</p>
<p>Now  given the number N,Professor Eric wants to know how many relations of kind R1 and R2 exists.Help him. </p>
<p> <b>NOTE :</b> (x,y) is the same as (y,x) ,i.e the pairs are <b>unordered</b>.</p>
<h3>Input format:</h3>

<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the test case is denoted by a single integer N.</p>
<h3>Output format:</h3>

<p>Output T lines, one for each test case,containing  two integers denoting the number of relations of kind R1 and R2 respectively, modulo 100000007.</p>

<b>Sample Input:</b>

<b>Sample Output:</b>
0 0
1 0
6 3
<b>Constraints:</b>
1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^18
<b>Explanation:</b>
Let A={1,2}
Then B={Phi,{1},{2},{1,2}}
Phi=Empty Set
So R1=Either {({1},{2})} or {({2},{1})}
and R2=No relation exists
So,there is 1 relation of kind R1 and 0 relation of kind R2.
