<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>The chef has a recipe he wishes to use for his guests,<br>
but the recipe will make far more food than he can serve to the guests.<br>
The chef therefore would like to make a reduced version of the recipe which has the same ratios of ingredients, but makes less food.<br>
The chef, however, does not like fractions.<br>
The original recipe contains only whole numbers of ingredients,<br>
and the chef wants the reduced recipe to only contain whole numbers of ingredients as well.<br>
Help the chef determine how much of each ingredient to use in order to make as little food as possible.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case consists of a single line.<br>
The line begins with a positive integer N, the number of ingredients.<br>
N integers follow, each indicating the quantity of a particular ingredient that is used.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output exactly N space-separated integers on a line,<br>
giving the quantity of each ingredient that the chef should use in order to make as little food as possible.</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>3
2 4 4
3 2 3 4
