<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>The chef is having a dinner party.<br>
He has N chairs and has invited N guests.<br>
The chef knows that if the guests are left to their own devices,<br>
they tend to sit in the same chairs and socialize with the same people all night.<br>
To prevent this, the chef has developed a plan to help people socialize.<br>
He will assign each chair a follow-up chair.<br>
At predetermined intervals during the party, the chef will ring a bell, instructing all guests<br>
to move from their current chair to its follow-up chair.</p>
<p>The chef will assign follow-up chairs randomly, with the restriction that no chair will<br>
be its own follow-up chair, and no two chairs will have the same follow-up chair.  That is, the chef randomly chooses one arrangement out of all assignments satisfying the two conditions.<br>
The chef wonders, after a certain number of ringings of the bell,<br>
what the expected number of guests who will be back in their original chairs<br>
will be.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br>
Each test case consists of a single line with 2 integers N and R,<br>
the number of chairs and number of ringings, respectively.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a single line the expected number<br>
of guests who will be back in their original seats after exactly R<br>
ringings, rounded to 5 decimal places.</p>
