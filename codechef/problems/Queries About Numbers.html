<p>Chef loves number theory very much. Now it is time to solve a new kind of problem.</p>
<p>There is given a natural number <b>N</b>. Chef has to answer <b>Q</b> queries of the form <b>T K</b>.</p>
<p>Here <b>T</b> is the type of query and <b>K</b> is the natural number.<br><br>If <b>T=</b>1, Chef must find the number of natural numbers which is divisor of both <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>.<br><br>If <b>T=</b>2, Chef must find the number of natural numbers which is divisor of <b>N</b> and is divisible by <b>K</b>.<br><br>If <b>T=</b>3, Chef must find the number of natural numbers which is divisor of <b>N</b> and is not divisible by <b>K</b>.<br><br><br>Chef can solve all these queries, but you will be hungry for night if this happens, because Chef will not have free time to cook a meal. Therefore you compromise with him and decided that everyone must do his/her own job. You must program and Chef must cook.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There will be 2 numbers in the first line: <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b>.<br><br><b>Q</b> lines follow with 2 numbers each: <b>T</b> and <b>K</b></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each of the <b>Q</b> lines you must output the result for corresponding query in separat line.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
12 6

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Numbers for each query:<br><br>{1,2,3,6}<br><br>{1,2}<br><br>{4,12}<br><br>{3,6,12}<br><br>{1,2,3,4,6}<br><br>{1,2,3,4,6,12}</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
