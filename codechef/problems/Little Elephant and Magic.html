The Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv believes in magic.
</p>
<p>
He has a magic board <b>A</b> that consists of <b>N</b> rows and <b>M</b> columns. Each cell of the board contains an integer from <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> inclusive. The cell at the intersection of the <b>i</b>-th row and the <b>j</b>-th column is denoted as <b>(i; j)</b>, where <b>1</b> ≤ <b>i</b> ≤ <b>N</b> and <b>1</b> ≤ <b>j</b> ≤ <b>M</b>. The number in the cell <b>(i; j)</b> is denoted as <b>A[i][j]</b>.
</p>
<p>
The Little Elephant owns the only magic operation which can be described as follows. He chooses some integer <b>P</b> and some row or column, after that for each cell in the chosen row or column he adds number <b>P</b> to the number in this cell and take the result modulo <b>10</b> in order to keep numbers in the range <b>{0, 1, ..., 9}</b>. Our Little Magician wants to perform series of such operations to achieve some board for which certain characteristic called <i>level of the board</i> is maximal possible.
</p>
<p>
So what is the level of the board? Bluntly speaking it is the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence of cells of the board. Formally, the level of the board is the maximal integer <b>K</b> such that there exists such sequence of <b>different</b> cells <b>(i<sub>1</sub>; j<sub>1</sub>), (i<sub>2</sub>; j<sub>2</sub>), ..., (i<sub>K</sub>; j<sub>K</sub>)</b> for which
</p>
<p>
<b>1</b> ≤ <b>i<sub>1</sub></b> ≤ ... ≤ <b>i<sub>K</sub></b> ≤ <b>N</b>, <br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>j<sub>1</sub></b> ≤ ... ≤ <b>j<sub>K</sub></b> ≤ <b>M</b>,
</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>
<b>A[i<sub>1</sub>][j<sub>1</sub>]</b> ≥ <b>A[i<sub>2</sub>][j<sub>2</sub>]</b> ≥ ... ≥ <b>A[i<sub>K</sub>][j<sub>K</sub>]</b>.
</p>
<p>
Though, the magic operation, the Little Elephant owns, is quite powerful, there are some restrictions dictated by the Association of Cursed Magicians (ACM):
</p>

<p></p><ul><li>The number <b>P</b> should be chosen in advance and should be the same for all operations.</li>
<li>For each row the magic operation can be applied at most once.</li>
<li>The same, of course, is true for columns.</li>
</ul><p>
Without these stupid restrictions of this stupid Association our hero could always achieve the maximal possible level <b>M + N − 1</b>. But now he is confused and asks you for help. Find the maximal level of the board <b>A</b> after making arbitrary number of magic operations according to the restrictions of ACM.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Then <b>T</b> test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, the sizes of the board. Each of the following <b>N</b> lines contains <b>M</b> one-digit numbers without spaces. The <b>i</b>-th line among them contains the numbers <b>A[i][1]</b>, ..., <b>A[i][M]</b>.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For each test case output a single line containing a single integer, the maximal possible level of the board that Little Elephant can achieve under the restrictions of ACM.
</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
<b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>10</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ <b>100</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>M</b> ≤ <b>100</b><br><b>0</b> ≤ <b>A[i][j]</b> ≤ <b>9</b>

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
<b>Case 1.</b> The board already has a sequence of <b>3</b> cells that satisfies all required constraints (without applying any operation). For example, one can choose, the sequence <b>(1; 1), (1; 2), (2; 2)</b>. It is also shown in the figure below (chosen cells are made bold):
</p>
<p></p><pre>
<b>11</b>
1<b>0</b>
</pre>
<p>
Let's formally validate this sequence of cells. Inequality <b>1</b> ≤ <b>i<sub>1</sub></b> ≤ ... ≤ <b>i<sub>K</sub></b> ≤ <b>N</b> takes the form <b>1</b> ≤ <b>1</b> ≤ <b>2</b>. Inequality <b>1</b> ≤ <b>j<sub>1</sub></b> ≤ ... ≤ <b>j<sub>K</sub></b> ≤ <b>M</b> takes the form <b>1</b> ≤ <b>2</b> ≤ <b>2</b>. Finally, inequality <b>A[i<sub>1</sub>][j<sub>1</sub>]</b> ≥ <b>A[i<sub>2</sub>][j<sub>2</sub>]</b> ≥ ... ≥ <b>A[i<sub>K</sub>][j<sub>K</sub>]</b> takes the form <b>1</b> ≥ <b>1</b> ≥ <b>0</b>. So all of them is satisfied, which means that the level of this board is at least <b>3</b>. But clearly, we can't have the required sequence of cells of length more than <b>3</b>. So <b>3</b> is the actual level of this board.
</p>
<p>
<b>Case 2.</b> The desired sequence of length <b>5</b> can be achieved by several values of <b>P</b>. Consider, for example, <b>P = 3</b>. At first let's apply the magic operation to the 1st row. We get the following transformation:
</p>
<p></p><pre>
3478  →  <b>6701</b>
4268  →  4268
7173  →  7173
</pre>
<p>
Now let's transform the 1st column by the magic operation. We get:
</p>
<p></p><pre>
6701  →  <b>9</b>701
4268  →  <b>7</b>268
7173  →  <b>0</b>173
</pre>
<p>
Finally we modify the 2nd column:
</p>
<p></p><pre>
9701  →  9<b>0</b>01
7268  →  7<b>5</b>68
0173  →  0<b>4</b>73
</pre>
<p>
Now we can take the following sequence of 5 cells to satisfy all needed constraints: <b>(1; 1), (2; 1), (2; 2), (3; 2), (3; 4)</b> (see the figure below):
</p>
<p></p><pre>
<b>9</b>001
<b>75</b>68
0<b>4</b>7<b>3</b>
</pre>
<p>
Just to reiterate we note that the inequality <b>A[i<sub>1</sub>][j<sub>1</sub>]</b> ≥ <b>A[i<sub>2</sub>][j<sub>2</sub>]</b> ≥ ... ≥ <b>A[i<sub>K</sub>][j<sub>K</sub>]</b> takes the form <b>9 ≥ 7 ≥ 5 ≥ 4 ≥ 3</b> for this sequence. One can check (for example, by brute force), that sequences of length more than <b>5</b> can't be achieved. So <b>5</b> is the answer.
