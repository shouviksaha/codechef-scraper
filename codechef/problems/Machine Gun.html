<p>
Country X has a military zone framed as a grid of size MxN.<br>
Each point of the grid could be free, occupied by a machine gun or by a protector.
</p>
<p>
A machine gun at point (x, y) could automatically attack other guns at points (x-2, y-2), (x-2, y+2), (x+2, y-2) and (x+2, y+2).<br>
So we could not put two guns at points which make them destroy each others,<br>
unless there is a protector exactly in the middle.<br>
Eg.: We could put two guns at point (x, y) and (x+2, y+2) if and only if there is a protector at point (x+1, y+1).</p>
<p>
Given a map with some points which has been occupied by guns or protectors,<br>
your task is to find out the greatest number of guns to add to this map satisfying rules above.<br>
Note that we can put a machine gun at a free point, but we cannot remove any machine gun and protector, and we cannot add protectors.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>There are several test cases, each formed as follows:</p>
<ul><li>The first line contains two positive integer M, N.</li>
<li>Next M lines, each contains N characters (no spaces) of {'F', 'G', 'P'} (ASCII: #70, #71, #80), the j-th character of the i-th line represents the point (i-1, j-1) on the map: 'F' is a free point, 'G' is occupied by a machine gun and 'P' is occupied by a protector.</li>
</ul><p>The input is ended with M = N = 0.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output on a line the greatest number of guns which can be added the given map.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
1 ≤ M, N ≤ 700<br>
In the given map, any two machine guns do not attack each other.<br>
The sum of MxN does not exceed 490000 in one judge file.
