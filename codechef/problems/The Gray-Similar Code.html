The Gray code (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code">wikipedia</a> for more details) is a well-known concept.<br>
One of its important properties is that every two adjacent numbers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation.
</p>
<p>
In this problem, we will give you <b>n</b> non-negative integers in a sequence <b>A[1..n] (0&lt;=A[i]&lt;2^64)</b>, such that every two adjacent integers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation, similar to the Gray code.
</p>
<p>
Your task is to check whether there exist 4 numbers <b>A[i1], A[i2], A[i3], A[i4] (1 &lt;= i1 &lt; i2 &lt; i3 &lt; i4 &lt;= n)</b> out of the given <b>n</b> numbers such that <b>A[i1] xor A[i2] xor A[i3] xor A[i4] = 0</b>. Here <b>xor</b> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">bitwise operation</a> which is same as <b>^</b> in C, C++, Java and <b>xor</b> in Pascal.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains one integer <b>n (4&lt;=n&lt;=100000)</b>.<br>
Second line contains <b>n</b> space seperated non-negative integers denoting the sequence <b>A</b>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output “Yes” (quotes exclusive) if there exist four distinct indices <b>i1, i2, i3, i4</b> such that <b>A[i1] xor A[i2] xor A[i3] xor A[i4] = 0</b>. Otherwise, output "No" (quotes exclusive) please.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
