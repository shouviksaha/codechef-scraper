<p>Being in love with number theory, Johnny decided to take a number theory course. On the first day, he was challenged by his teacher with the following problem: given a number N, compute the product of its positive divisors. Johnny is desperate to impress his new teacher so he asks you for help.</p>
<p>In this problem, the divisors of N do not include the number N itself. For example, if N=12, the divisors of N (excluding N) are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Thus, the product of divisors is 1x2x3x4x6=144. Since the result may be very large, if the result has more than 4 decimal digits, Johnny only needs to compute the <b>last 4 digits</b> of it.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 300,000). Then t test cases follow.</p>
<p>Each test case contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500,000) whose product of divisors needs to be computed.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, print a single line containing the corresponding result of that test case.</p>
