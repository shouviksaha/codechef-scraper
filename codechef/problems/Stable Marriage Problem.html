<h3>All submissions for this problem are available.</h3>
<p>There are given <i>n</i> men and <i>n</i> women.<br>
Each woman ranks all men in order of her preference<br>
(her first choice, her second choice, and so on).<br>
Similarly, each man sorts all women according to<br>
his preference. The goal is to arrange <i>n</i><br>
marriages in such a way that if a man <i>m</i><br>
prefers some woman <i>w</i> more than his wife, and <i>w</i> prefers <i>m</i> more then her husband a new marriage occurs between <i>w</i> and <i>m</i>.  If <i>w</i> prefers her husband more, then she stays married to him.  This problem always has a solution and your task is to find one.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains a positive integer <i>t</i>&lt;=100<br>
indicating the number of test cases. Each test case is an<br>
instance of the stable marriage problem defined above.<br>
The first line of each test case is a positive integer<br><i>n</i>&lt;=500 (the number of marriages to find).<br>
The next <i>n</i> lines are the woman's preferences: <i>i</i>th<br>
line contains the number <i>i</i> (which means that this is the list given<br>
by the <i>i</i>th woman) and the numbers of men<br>
(the first choice of <i>i</i>th woman, the second choice,...).<br>
Then, the men's preferences follow in the same format.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case print <i>n</i> lines, where each line<br>
contains two numbers <i>m</i> and <i>w</i>, which means that<br>
the man number <i>m</i> and the woman number <i>w</i> should get married.</p>
