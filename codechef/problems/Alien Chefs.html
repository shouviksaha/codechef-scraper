The aliens living in outer space are very advanced in technology,<br>
intelligence and everything, except one, and that is Cooking.<br>
Each year they spend millions of dollars in research, to crack famous recipes prepared by humans.</p>
<p align="justify">
Recently they came to know about Khana-Academy,<br>
a non-profit organization streaming free cooking lesson videos on earth.<br>
There are <b>N</b> recipes,<br>
numbered 1 to <b>N</b>, and the video of the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> recipe is live in the time interval [<b>S</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <b>E</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>].<br>
An alien can visit earth but can not survive for more than just a small moment (earth is so advanced in pollution).<br>
An alien visits the earth at an integer time <b>t</b> and instantly downloads the complete video of all the lessons<br>
that are live at that moment of time <b>t</b> and leaves earth immediately.<br>
You are given the visiting times of a small group of <b>K</b> aliens.<br>
Find the number of different recipes aliens can learn by watching the downloaded videos.<br>
Not just one group of aliens, there are <b>Q</b> such groups,<br>
so you have to find the answer for each of these <b>Q</b> groups.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>

<p align="justify">
The first line has an integer <b>N</b>.<br>
Each of the following <b>N</b> lines has two integers <b>S</b><sub><i>i</i></sub><b>E</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>.<br>
The next line has an integer <b>Q</b>, the number of groups.<br>
Each of the following <b>Q</b> lines has information of a group of aliens.<br>
The first integer is <b>K</b>, the number of aliens in that group, followed by <b>K</b> integers in the same line,<br>
the integer visiting times <b>t</b> of the aliens.</p>
<p>1 ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ 100000 (10<sup>5</sup>)<br>
1 ≤ <b>Q</b> ≤ 5000 (5 · 10<sup>3</sup>)<br>
1 ≤ <b>K</b> ≤ 20<br>
1 ≤ <b>S</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <b>E</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <b>t</b> ≤ 1000000000 (10<sup>9</sup>)<br><b>S</b><sub><i>i</i></sub> &lt; <b>E</b><sub><i>i</i></sub></p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<p align="justify">
For each of the <b>Q</b> groups, output the number of different recipes that group of aliens can learn by watching the downloaded videos.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<b>Input:</b>
4
1 4
3 10

<b>Explanation:</b><br>
Given videos of 4 recipes in the following closed intervals.<br>
1. [ 1 , 4 ]<br>
2. [ 3 , 10 ]<br>
3. [ 2 , 6 ]<br>
4. [ 5 , 8 ]</p>
<p>In the first query, only one alien arrives at t = 5 and can download 3 recipes 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p>In the second query, two aliens arrive at t = 2 and 6. They can learn all the 4 recipes.</p>
<p>In the third query, three aliens arrive at t = 1, 10 and 9. They can learn only two recipes, 1 and 2.</p>
