<p>Alice and Bob play the following game.They choose a number N to play with.The runs are as follows :</p>
<p>1.Bob plays first and the two players alternate.</p>
<p>2.In his/her turn ,a player can subtract from N any prime     number(including 1) less than N.The number thus obtained is the new N.</p>
<p>3.The person who cannot make a move in his/her turn loses the game.</p>
<p>Assuming both play optimally,who wins the game ?</p>
<h3>Input format:</h3>

<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the next lines contains an integer N.</p>
<h3>Output format:</h3>

<p>Output T lines one for each test case,containing "ALICE" if Alice wins the game ,or "BOB" if Bob wins the game.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Sample Input:</b>
2
1
2
<br><b>Sample Output:</b>
ALICE
BOB
<br><b>Constraints:</b>
1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000000
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000000000
</pre><p>
Note : For the first test case, Bob cannot make any move and hence Alice wins the game. For the second test case, Bob subtracts 1 from N. Now, Alice cannot make a move and loses the game.</p>
