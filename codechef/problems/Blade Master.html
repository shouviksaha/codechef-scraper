Loda and Maelk are legendary ChefCraft players. They have played so many games that this number doesn't fit in </p>
<p>a standard 32-bit integer type. Today Loda and Maelk are going to sort the things out and find out who is the </p>
<p>greatest ChefCraft player ever. So the great fight is coming. There are a lot of different heroes you may </p>
<p>choose to play ChefCraft. Obviously every hero has his pros and cons. Loda perfectly plays Blade Master. His </p>
<p>main skill is to make mirror images of himself to spoof the enemy.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
As every other popular game ChefCraft is played on a rectangular grid which consists of <b>N</b> rows and </p>
<p><b>M</b> columns. Rows of the grid are numbered by integers from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>. So the upper row of the </p>
<p>grid has number <b>1</b> and the lower row has number <b>N</b>. The same holds for columns. They are numbered </p>
<p>by integers from <b>1</b> to <b>M</b> such that the most left column has number <b>1</b> while the most right </p>
<p>column has number <b>M</b>.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
At the beginning of the game the only Blade Master's image stands on some starting cell <b>(Sx, Sy)</b> where </p>
<p><b>1 ≤ Sx ≤ N</b> and <b>1 ≤ Sy ≤ M</b>. Then Loda makes <b>T</b> moves. Maelk knows how the </p>
<p>distribution of images on the grid changes after each Loda's move. This happens according to the following </p>
<p>rules.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>1.</b> If there is an image standing on the cell <b>(i, j)</b> then the new images appear by the next </p>
<p>rules:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Let <b>F(i, j)</b> be the total number of images in the "cross" of the cell <b>(i, j)</b>. The "cross" of
<p>the cell <b>(i, j)</b> is union of all cells in the <b>i</b>-th row of the grid and in the <b>j</b>-th column </p>
<p>of the grid. So <b>N + M − 1</b> cells belongs to the "cross".</p></li>
<li>Let <b>X = F(i, j) mod 6</b>, that is <b>X</b> is the remainder of the division of <b>F(i, j)</b> by
<p><b>6</b>.</p></li>
<li>For every possible value of <b>X</b> we have following values: <b>D1</b>, <b>D2</b>, <b>P1 </b> and
<p><b>P2</b>.</p></li>
<li><b>D1</b> and <b>D2</b> may be equal to one of the <b>4</b> values <b>['U', 'R', 'D', 'L']</b> and mean
<p>some two directions. Here <b>'U'</b> means <b>up</b>, <b>'R'</b> means <b>right</b>, <b>'D'</b> means </p>
<p><b>down</b> and <b>'L'</b> means <b>left</b>.</p></li>
<li><b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b> are integer numbers.</li>
<li>New mirror images will appear at every cell in the direction <b>D1</b> with the period <b>P1</b> starting
<p>from cell <b>(i, j)</b> and in the direction <b>D2</b> with the period <b>P2</b> also starting from the cell </p>
<p><b>(i, j)</b>. Of course, no images will appear out of the grid. For example, if <b>D1 = 'U'</b> and <b>P1 = </b></p>
<p>2 then images appear at the cells <b>(i − 2, j), (i − 4, j), (i − 6, j)</b>, and so </p>
<p>on.</p></li>
<li>Loda always use the same values for <b>D1</b> and <b>D2</b>. Namely,<br><b>D1 = 'U', D2 = 'D'</b> for <b>X = 0,</b><br><b>D1 = 'L', D2 = 'R'</b> for <b>X = 1,</b><br><b>D1 = 'U', D2 = 'R'</b> for <b>X = 2,</b><br><b>D1 = 'R', D2 = 'D'</b> for <b>X = 3,</b><br><b>D1 = 'D', D2 = 'L'</b> for <b>X = 4,</b><br><b>D1 = 'L', D2 = 'U'</b> for <b>X = 5.</b></li>
<li>But values <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b> may vary for different games. But once chosen they will be the same for
<p>all moves.</p></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>
<b>2.</b> Appearing of new mirror images happens immediately.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>3.</b> Whenever there is more than one image at the cell they start one on one fights. In each fight two </p>
<p>images participate and both die. So if the number of images in the cell was even than all images will </p>
<p>disappear in the end, otherwise exactly one image will remain at this cell.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Now Maelk wants to choose his hero in order to win the fight. The most important thing he needs to know for </p>
<p>this is how the number of images changes during Loda's moves. So he asks you for help. Denote by <b>C(t)</b> </p>
<p>the number of images on the grid after the <b>t</b>-th Loda's move for <b>t</b> from <b>1</b> to <b>T</b>. For </p>
<p>convenience we denote <b>C(0) = 1</b> with meaning that <b>0</b>-th move is the putting of the only Blade </p>
<p>Master's image at the starting cell. Maelk wants you to calculate the sum <b>C(0) + C(1) + ... + C(T)</b>. </p>
<p>Since Maelk doesn't know what to expect from Loda he would like to know the answer for several values of </p>
<p><b>T</b>. As you remember the total number of games played by Maelk and Loda at ChefCraft doesn't fit in a </p>
<p>standard 32-bit integer type. Of course, the same can hold for the number of moves in their final fight. Since </p>
<p>Maelk plays ChefCraft the whole life he is not strong in math and can't calculate such large sums. So let's </p>
<p>help him to win the final fight and become the only ChefCraft master ever.
</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line of the input contains three space separated integers <b>N</b>, <b>M </b> and <b>Q</b>. Here </p>
<p><b>N</b> and <b>M</b> are sizes of the grid described above and <b>Q</b> is the number of Maelk's queries. The </p>
<p>second line contains two space separated integers <b>Sx</b> and <b>Sy</b>, row index and column index of the </p>
<p>starting position of the first image. Each of the following six lines contains two space separated integers, </p>
<p>the values <b>P1</b> and <b>P2 </b> for the corresponding <b>X</b>, that is, <b>i</b>-th line among these six </p>
<p>lines contains values <b>P1</b> and <b>P2 </b> for <b>X = i − 1</b>. Each of the following <b>Q</b> </p>
<p>lines contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of Loda's moves for the corresponding Maelk's query.
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
For every Maelk's query output on a separate line the numbers of images Maelk will see during Loda's move.
</p>
<h3>Constrains</h3>
<p>
<b>N</b> and <b>M</b> are positive<br><b>N</b> • <b>M</b> ≤ <b>34</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>Sx</b> ≤ <b>N</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>Sy</b> ≤ <b>M</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>P1</b>, <b>P2</b> ≤ <b>max{N, M}</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>Q</b> ≤ <b>100</b><br><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>10<sup>16</sup></b>

</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
The initial grid looks as follows:<br>
100<br>
000<br>
000<br>
Here '1' represents a cell with an image and '0' represents a free cell.</p>
<p>After the first move grid is<br>
111<br>
000<br>
000</p>
<p>After the second move grid is<br>
101<br>
111<br>
111</p>
<p>Finally, after the third move we have<br>
011<br>
101<br>
010</p>
<p>So after the first move Maelk will see <b>3</b> images, after the second move – <b>8</b> images and </p>
<p>after the third move – <b>5</b> images. Hence the answers for <b>T = 1, 2, 3</b> are <b>1 + 3 = 4</b>, </p>
<p><b>1 + 3 + 8 = 12</b> and <b>1 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 17</b> respectively.</p>
