<p>In the magic land, there is a smart but naughty boy Crane.</p>
<p>Crane has <strong>n</strong> houses, and <strong>n</strong> friends (both numbered from 1 to <strong>n</strong>).<br>
Crane's mother has scheduled a plan for all his friends<br>
such that each friend visits each house of Crane <strong>exactly once</strong><br>
at a different time, i.e.,<br>
there is at most one friend in any house at any time.</p>
<p>But like Crane all his friends are also naughty.<br>
Therefore his mother wants to lock away each of his friends in distinct houses.<br>
What she'll do is to choose a distinct house for each friend. As that friend visits<br>
that house, he'll be locked in that house.  That is, Crane's mother wants to find a<br>
sequence <strong>block</strong> such that<br>
the <strong>i-th</strong> friend will be locked in <strong>block[i]-th</strong> house<br>
once he visits that house. As she wants to ensure that there is at maximum one<br>
person in each house, she must choose the sequence <strong>block</strong> such<br>
that if friend A visits house H at time T, and he is locked away in the house, then no other friends visit house H<br>
after time T. </p>
<p>Help Crane's mother to find such a sequence <strong>block</strong>. </p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>First line contains a single integer <strong>n</strong> (1 ≤ <strong>n</strong><br>
≤ 100), indicating the number of friends and houses.</p>
<p>Then <strong>n</strong> lines follow, with each line containing <strong>n</strong> positive integers.<br>
The <strong>j-th</strong> integer in <strong>i-th</strong> line indicates the time when the <strong>i-th</strong> friend will visit the <strong>j-th</strong> house. All times will fit in signed 32-bit integer.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>If there exists a sequence <strong>block</strong> that satisfies the constraints, then output <strong>block[1] block[2] ... block[n]</strong> in one line, separated by a single space.</p>
<p>Otherwise if there is no such sequence, output <strong>-1</strong> in one line.<br>
If there are multiple answers, then anyone will do.</p>
