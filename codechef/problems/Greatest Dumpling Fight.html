Chef Shifu and Chef Po are participating in the Greatest Dumpling Fight of 2012.<br>
Of course, Masterchef Oogway has formed the rules of the fight.
</p>
<p>
There is a long horizontal rope of infinite length with a center point P.<br>
Initially both Chef Shifu and Chef Po will stand on the center P of the rope facing each other.<br>
Don't worry, the rope is thick enough to hold Chef Po and Chef Shifu at the same place and at the same time.<br>
Chef Shifu can jump either <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> units to the left or right in one move.<br>
Chef Po can jump either <b>C</b> or <b>D</b> units to the left or right in one move.
</p>
<p>
Masterchef Oogway wants to place exactly one dumpling on the rope such that<br>
both Chef Shifu and Chef Po will be able to reach it independently in one or more moves.<br>
Also the dumpling can be placed at most <b>K</b> units away from the center of the rope.<br>
Masterchef Oogway will let you watch the fight if you can decide the number of possible positions on the rope to place the dumpling.
</p>

<p></p><h3>Input</h3>

<p>
First line contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Each of the next <b>T</b> lines contains five positive integers, <b>A B C D K</b>.
</p>
<p>
1&lt;=<b>T</b>&lt;=1000<br>
1&lt;=<b>A</b>,<b>B</b>,<b>C</b>,<b>D</b>,<b>K</b>&lt;=10^18
</p>
<h3>Output</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
3
2 4 3 6 7
1 2 4 5 1
10 12 3 9 16

<b>Output:</b>
3
3
5

<b>Explanation:</b>

For the second case,

Chef Po jumps 2 units to the right and then 1 unit to the left.
Chef Shifu jumps 5 units to the right and then 4 units to the left 
to reach 1 unit right from the center.

Chef Po jumps 2 units to the left and then 1 unit to the right.
Chef Shifu jumps 5 units to the left and then 4 units to the right 
to reach 1 unit left from the center.

Dumpling can also be placed at the center as a chef can reach it in 2 moves.
Thus, there are three different positions at most 1 unit away from the center 
that are reachable by both the chefs in one or more moves.
