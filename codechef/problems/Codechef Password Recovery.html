Chef recently decided a very curious encryption algorithm for CodeChef passwords. He took an N-letter password and found all the possible<br>
2-letter substrings, considering the characters of a password was written in a circle. Thus, for AbcD, he would deduce the following<br>
substrings: Ab, bc, cD, DA.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Then, some of the substrings were reversed. For example, the set of substrings above could be converted to Ab, cb, Dc, DA. All<br>
the substrings were then stored in a database. Whenever the need be, the substrings were recovered, and a password was generated. Of course<br>
sometimes, more than one such password could be generated, but Chef thinks this is perfectly fine!
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Unfortunately, a programming error by the new CodeChef minion, led to corruption of this database and mixed all the strings together.<br>
Chef now wants to retrieve the passwords, a few at a time. He gives you a set of substrings A from some of the passwords - these you<br>
should always consider, and another set of substrings B from which you can use some. Can you tell him if it is possible to select all the substrings<br>
from A and some (0 or more) substrings from B and construct 1 or more passwords? Each selected string can be used only once, for at max 1<br>
password. See explanation of Sample Input for clarification.

</p><h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
Each test case contains 2 lines.<br>
The first line of the test case contains the number N (= |A|), followed by the N substrings Chef gives in A. The next line contains<br>
M (= |B|), followed by M substrings. Two substrings are input with a single space character between them.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><h3>Output</h3>

<p>Print T lines, one for each test case. Output either "YES" if it is possible to select all strings from A and some strings from B<br>
such that the overall set of strings represent the substrings for 1 or more passwords. Output "NO" otherwise.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
</p><h3>Constraints</h3>
<pre>1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
1 ≤ M ≤ 1000
All characters would be upper case or lower case English letters. Passwords are case sensitive.

</p><h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>In the first Sample Input, you can construct "aBaC" from (<strong>aB</strong> <strong>aB</strong> <strong>Ca</strong> Ca) and<br>
"aBc" from (<strong>Bc</strong> aB ca). Strings selected from A are shown in bold. Remember that substrings can be reversed. Note<br>
that although there are repeated strings, each string is used in at most one of the passwords.
